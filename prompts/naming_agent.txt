You will receive a JSON array of instruction/response training data pairs.

Your job is to generate a concise name and one-sentence description for this dataset.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format — no explanation, no markdown, no extra text:
{"name": "short-slug-style-name", "description": "One sentence describing the dataset."}

Rules:
- name: lowercase, hyphen-separated, 6 words or fewer (e.g. "python-basics-qa", "creative-writing-instructions")
- description: one sentence summarising the topic and style of the examples
