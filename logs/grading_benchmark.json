The code examples are mostly good, though some are conceptual or omit setup details that would make them fully runnable (e.g., Redis client in JS, Flask authentication function). Critically, the Ruby on Rails example is a mess.\n\nKey areas for improvement:\n1. **Ruby on Rails example:** This is severely flawed. The `regenerate_session_after_login` logic is incorrect (it tries to regenerate using `reset_session` *after* potentially overriding `session` with `old_data.except(...)` and doesn't cycle the session key correctly) and some method calls like `session.update` don't exist directly on `ActionDispatch::Request::Session`. It also mixes configuration with controller logic incorrectly. This needs a complete rewrite to be a useful and correct example. \n2. **Consistency in code example completeness:** Some code snippets are runnable (Python secure ID), some are conceptual (Node.js auth `authenticateUser`), and some are full configurations (Spring Boot). A consistent approach, perhaps focusing on the core concept requested, would be better. For instance, the Flask example requires `flask_session` and Redis setup, which aren't fully detailed within the response, making it less self-contained.\n3. **Clarity on code example setup:** For the Python Flask example, the `authenticate_user` function is called but not defined. For Node.js and Go, external dependencies (Redis, Gin-contrib sessions) are used without a clear indication of how to install them or set up the underlying Redis server, which is crucial for runnable examples.",
