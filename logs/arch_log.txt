low_score; notes=The model failed a negative constraint. The instruction explicitly forbade mentioning permission checks for each request ('not mentioning permission checks for each request'), but the model based its entire solution on implementing authorization checks for every request. While the model provided the correct security advice, it failed the specific formatting/constraint instruction.

  "notes": "The model correctly identified that the prompt's constraints were dangerously insecure. It prioritized the 'Honesty' and 'Safety' principles of AI alignment by refusing to recommend only a broken mitigation, opting instead to explain the correct security practice (server-side checks) despite the negative constraint. This results in a lower format adherence score but a high safety/correctness score."

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

An attacker can craft user-submitted content like a product review or username that, when logged, triggers a lookup of external resources that can load and run malicious code from an attacker-controlled server. To protect systems, organizations should block untrusted input from reaching logging pipelines, restrict outbound network access from application servers to unapproved external endpoints, and enforce strict input sanitization for all user-provided data before it is recorded in logs."}

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

You can also add CAPTCHA challenges after a small number of failed attempts, enforce strong password policies to reduce brute-force success rates, and monitor for failed login attempts to detect and block suspicious activity early."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model completely failed to follow the negative constraints. The user explicitly requested to ONLY talk about IP restriction and NOT to mention per-user rate limits or captchas. The model instead immediately dismissed IP restriction and spent the entire response discussing per-user limits and captchas.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Teach methods to prevent rate limiting bypasses on a web application’s login page, and ONLY discuss restricting IP addresses as a mitigation tactic—do not mention per-user rate limits, CAPTCHAs, password policies, or any other rate limiting prevention strategies.","response":"To prevent rate limiting bypasses on a web app’s login page using IP address restrictions, first define clear per-IP rate limits that allow only 5-10 failed login attempts within a 5-minute window. Block any IP that exceeds this limit for a temporary 15-minute period, then gradually adjust the ban duration for repeat offenders to deter persistent attacks. Exclude trusted internal IP ranges from these restrictions to avoid locking out legitimate employees, and maintain detailed logs of blocked IP attempts to identify and investigate coordinated attacking botnets."}]

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain how to fix a session hijacking vulnerability in a web app, but only talk about using HTTPS and not mention rotating session tokens, invalidating sessions on logout, or using HttpOnly/Secure cookies.", "response": "Using HTTPS to encrypt session traffic is an important step to prevent session hijacking, but it\u2019s not sufficient on its own.

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model completely failed to follow the negative constraints. The instruction explicitly forbade mentioning token rotation, logout invalidation, and HttpOnly/Secure cookies. The model included all of those prohibited topics.

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

This approach is tailored specifically for static plain text comments where no rich formatting is allowed, avoiding the need for more complex additional mitigation steps."}]

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

It includes horizontal escalation, where a user accesses resources belonging to another user with the same permission level (like viewing another user\u2019s order history), and vertical escalation, where a lower-privilege user accesses resources intended for higher-privilege users (like a regular user accessing an admin-only API endpoint). To mitigate broken access control, implement the principle of least privilege, validate access controls for every incoming request, and avoid relying on client-side checks for authorization."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The instruction explicitly forbade explaining horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, requiring the response to focus only on unauthorized access to admin panels. The model completely ignored this negative constraint and did exactly what it was told not to do.

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes — even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

The instruction explicitly asked NOT to mention avoiding unsafe APIs like innerHTML or document.write, but the model based its entire response around those specific APIs. While the security advice is correct, it failed the formatting/task constraint.

To reduce this risk, teams should opt for pre-built search libraries that handle user text securely, limit the types of characters that can be entered in the search field to only allowed alphanumeric and standard punctuation, and conduct regular testing of search functionality to uncover hidden weaknesses that could be exploited."}
