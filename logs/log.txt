 Response: [
    {"instruction": "What are the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming?", "response": "The four main pillars of OOP are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction."},
    {"instruction": "How do you define a private attribute in a Python class to implement encapsulation?", "response": "In Python, you signal a private attribute by prefixing the attribute name with double underscores, such as self.__attribute. This triggers name mangling to prevent direct external access."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Method Overriding' with a simple code example.", "response": "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. Example: \nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        return 'Sound'\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return 'Bark'"},
    {"instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'super()' function in Python?", "response": "The super() function is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class. It is commonly used in the __init__ method to ensure the base class is properly initialized."},
    {"instruction": "How does Python handle multiple inheritance and what is MRO?", "response": "Python supports multiple inheritance where a class can derive from more than one parent. MRO stands for Method Resolution Order, which is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes, accessible via the .mro() method or __mro__ attribute."},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between a class attribute and an instance attribute?", "response": "A class attribute is shared by all instances of a class and defined outside the constructor. An instance attribute is unique to a specific object and is typically defined inside the __init__ method using self."},
    {"instruction": "How can you implement an abstract base class in Python?", "response": "You implement an abstract base class by importing the ABC class and the abstractmethod decorator from the 'abc' module. A class inheriting from ABC that contains at least one abstractmethod cannot be instantiated."},
    {"instruction": "What is the 'self' keyword actually doing in Python methods?", "response": "The 'self' parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows the method to access and modify attributes and methods belonging to that specific object."},
    {"instruction": "Explain Polymorphism in the context of Python functions.", "response": "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through the same interface. For example, a function might call .draw() on an object regardless of whether it is a Circle or a Square, as long as both implement that method."},
    {"instruction": "What are 'dunder' or magic methods in Python?", "response": "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods like __init__, __str__, and __add__ that allow you to define how objects behave with respect to built-in Python operations like initialization, printing, and arithmetic."},
    {"instruction": "Write a Python class 'Bank' with a protected member and a public method to access it.", "response": "class Bank:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self._balance = balance\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self._balance"},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?", "response": "@staticmethod does not receive an implicit first argument (neither self nor cls) and behaves like a plain function inside a class. @classmethod receives the class itself as the first argument (usually named cls), allowing it to access class-level state."},
    {"instruction": "How do you achieve composition over inheritance in Python?", "response": "Composition is achieved by including an instance of another class as an attribute in a new class, rather than inheriting from it. For example: class Car: def __init__(self): self.engine = Engine()."},
    {"instruction": "What is the utility of the __str__ and __repr__ methods?", "response": "__str__ is intended to provide a 'user-friendly' string representation of an object, while __repr__ is intended to provide an 'unambiguous' representation often used for debugging and should ideally look like the code used to create the object."},
    {"instruction": "How can you prevent a user from adding new attributes to an instance at runtime?", "response": "You can use the __slots__ declaration in a class. By defining __slots__ = ('attr1', 'attr2'), Python will only allow those specific attributes to exist, which also saves memory."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the 'Diamond Problem' in Python and how it's resolved.", "response": "The Diamond Problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a single base class. Python resolves this using the C3 Linearization algorithm to determine the Method Resolution Order (MRO)."},
    {"instruction": "What is an interface in Python, and how is it different from a standard class?", "response": "Python doesn't have a formal 'interface' keyword like Java. Interfaces are typically implemented using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) that contain only abstract methods, serving as a blueprint for what a class must do without providing the implementation."},
    {"instruction": "How do you implement property decorators (getters and setters) in Python?", "response": "Using the @property decorator for the getter, and @<attribute>.setter for the setter. Example:\n@property\ndef price(self):\n    return self._price\n@price.setter\ndef price(self, value):\n    self._price = value"},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Duck Typing'.", "response": "Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If an object has a 'quack' method, Python treats it as a 'duck' for that context, regardless of its actual inheritance hierarchy."},
    {"instruction": "What happens when you call a class in Python (e.g., my_obj = MyClass())?", "response": "Python first calls the __new__ method to create a new instance of the class, and then it calls the __init__ method to initialize that instance's state before returning the object."}

 Response: [
    {"instruction": "Explain the naming convention for RESTful resource URIs and provide three examples.", "response": "RESTful URIs should use nouns instead of verbs and represent collections and elements using plural nouns for consistency. Examples: 1. /users (all users), 2. /users/123 (specific user), 3. /users/123/orders (orders belonging to a specific user)."},
    {"instruction": "List four common HTTP methods used in REST and their standard CRUD mappings.", "response": "1. GET: Read/Retrieve a resource. 2. POST: Create a new resource. 3. PUT: Update/Replace an existing resource. 4. DELETE: Remove a resource."},
    {"instruction": "Create a table showing the appropriate HTTP status codes for the following scenarios: Success with content, Resource created, Invalid client request, and Internal server error.", "response": "Scenario | Status Code | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nSuccess with content | 200 OK | The request succeeded.\nResource created | 201 Created | A new resource was successfully created.\nInvalid client request | 400 Bad Request | The server cannot process the request due to client error.\nInternal server error | 500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the best practice for versioning a REST API.", "response": "The most common and recommended practice is to include the version number in the URI prefix, such as /v1/ or /v2/. This ensures that changes do not break existing integrations for clients using older versions."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the difference between PUT and PATCH methods in a RESTful context.", "response": "PUT is used to replace an entire resource with a new representation; if fields are omitted, they may be deleted or set to null. PATCH is used for partial updates, modifying only the specific fields provided in the request body."},
    {"instruction": "How should filtering and sorting be handled in a REST API? Provide an example URI.", "response": "Filtering and sorting should be handled via query parameters rather than part of the path. Example: /products?category=electronics&sort=price_desc&limit=10."},
    {"instruction": "What is HATEOAS and why is it used in REST design?", "response": "HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of REST where the server provides links in its responses to guide the client on available actions, allowing the client to navigate the API dynamically without hardcoding all URIs."},
    {"instruction": "Correct this non-RESTful URI: GET /getProductsByColor?color=red", "response": "The RESTful version should be: GET /products?color=red"},
    {"instruction": "Provide a JSON structure for a standard error response in a REST API.", "response": "{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": 404,\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\",\n    \"details\": \"The user with ID 55 does not exist in our database.\"\n  }\n}"},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of Idempotency and list which HTTP methods are idempotent.", "response": "Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once. Idempotent methods include GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS. POST is not idempotent because repeating it would create multiple resources."},
    {"instruction": "How should a REST API handle pagination? Mention the required metadata.", "response": "Pagination should use query parameters like 'page' and 'limit' (or 'offset' and 'limit'). The response should include metadata such as total_count, total_pages, and current_page, often wrapped in a 'meta' object."},
    {"instruction": "Why should trailing slashes be avoided in REST URIs?", "response": "Trailing slashes can cause confusion and potential duplicate content issues. It is best practice to treat /users and /users/ as the same resource, but strictly speaking, URIs are sensitive, so the standard is to omit the trailing slash for clarity."},
    {"instruction": "List the three main components of a JWT (JSON Web Token) often used for REST API authentication.", "response": "1. Header (algorithm and token type), 2. Payload (claims/data), 3. Signature (to verify the sender and ensure the message wasn't changed)."},
    {"instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Accept' and 'Content-Type' headers in a REST request?", "response": "The 'Content-Type' header tells the server the media type of the body being sent (e.g., application/json). The 'Accept' header tells the server which media types the client is capable of understanding for the response."},
    {"instruction": "Write a short guide on using sub-resources in REST URIs.", "response": "Sub-resources are used to represent objects that belong to another object. Use the pattern /parent-resource/{id}/child-resource. For example, to get all reviews for a specific book: GET /books/123/reviews."},
    {"instruction": "What HTTP status code should be returned if a client tries to access a protected resource without valid credentials?", "response": "The server should return 401 Unauthorized."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the 'Statelessness' constraint in REST.", "response": "Statelessness means that the server does not store any client context between requests. Each request from a client must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and process it, such as authentication tokens."},
    {"instruction": "Should secret keys or passwords be passed in the URI? Why or why not?", "response": "No, sensitive information should never be passed in the URI (query parameters or paths) because URIs are often logged in web server logs, browser history, and proxy logs. Use the HTTP Request Body or Headers instead."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the use of the 204 No Content status code.", "response": "204 No Content is used when a request is successfully processed (like a DELETE or a PUT) but the server does not need to return any data in the response body."},
    {"instruction": "How can a REST API improve performance for repeated requests of the same data?", "response": "By implementing Caching. The server can use 'Cache-Control' headers and 'ETags' to tell the client or intermediary proxies how long a resource can be stored locally before requesting it again."}

 Response: [
    {"instruction": "What does Big O notation represent in algorithm analysis?", "response": "Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in the worst-case scenario. It focuses on the growth rate of the complexity relative to the input size (n) as n approaches infinity, effectively ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms."},
    {"instruction": "Compare the time complexity of a linear search and a binary search on a sorted array.", "response": "Linear search has a time complexity of O(n) because, in the worst case, it must check every element in the array. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) because it halves the search space with each comparison, making it significantly more efficient for large sorted datasets."},
    {"instruction": "Calculate the time complexity of the following nested loop: for i from 1 to n: for j from 1 to i: print(j).", "response": "The outer loop runs n times. The inner loop runs 1 time when i=1, 2 times when i=2, up to n times when i=n. The total number of iterations is the sum of the first n integers: n(n + 1) / 2. In Big O notation, this simplifies to O(n^2)."},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between Auxiliary Space and Total Space Complexity?", "response": "Auxiliary Space refers specifically to the extra or temporary space used by an algorithm, excluding the space taken by the input itself. Total Space Complexity includes both the auxiliary space and the space used by the input data. For example, an in-place sorting algorithm has O(1) auxiliary space but O(n) total space complexity."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the time complexity of basic operations in a Hash Map.", "response": "In an ideal scenario with a good hash function and no collisions, operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup in a Hash Map are O(1) on average. However, in the worst-case scenario where many keys collide and are stored in a linked list or similar structure, the time complexity can degrade to O(n)."},
    {"instruction": "Define 'Amortized Analysis' with an example.", "response": "Amortized analysis finds the average time taken per operation over a sequence of operations, even if a single operation might be expensive. A classic example is a Dynamic Array (like Python's list or C++ vector). Most insertions are O(1), but when the capacity is reached, resizing takes O(n). Amortized, each insertion is still considered O(1)."},
    {"instruction": "What is the time and space complexity of Merge Sort?", "response": "Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst) because it always divides the array into halves and takes linear time to merge them. Its space complexity is O(n) due to the temporary arrays used during the merging process."},
    {"instruction": "A recursive function computes the nth Fibonacci number as: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). What is its time complexity?", "response": "The naive recursive implementation has a time complexity of O(2^n). This is because each call branches into two more calls, creating a binary tree of calls with a depth of n, leading to exponential growth in the number of calculations."},
    {"instruction": "How does the space complexity change when moving from a recursive DFS to an iterative DFS using a stack on a graph with V vertices and E edges?", "response": "Both typically have a space complexity of O(V) in the worst case. In recursion, the space is consumed by the call stack, while in the iterative version, it is consumed by the explicit Stack data structure. The depth of the search determines the space requirement."},
    {"instruction": "Which complexity is better: O(n log n) or O(n^2)?", "response": "O(n log n) is better. For small values of n, the difference might be negligible, but as n grows, O(n^2) grows much faster than O(n log n). For example, if n = 1,000, n log n is roughly 10,000, while n^2 is 1,000,000."},
    {"instruction": "What is the Big O complexity of a nested loop where the inner loop runs a constant number of times (e.g., 10 times) regardless of n?", "response": "The complexity is O(n). Since the inner loop runs a constant number of times (10), it is treated as a constant factor. O(10 * n) simplifies to O(n) in algorithm analysis."},
    {"instruction": "Analyze the space complexity of an algorithm that creates a 2D matrix of size n x n.", "response": "The space complexity is O(n^2) because the number of elements stored in the matrix scales with the square of the input size n."},
    {"instruction": "Explain why O(3^n) is considered worse than O(2^n).", "response": "Both are exponential time complexities, but O(3^n) grows at a significantly faster rate. For every increase of 1 in n, O(2^n) doubles while O(3^n) triples, leading to a massive divergence in execution time for large n."},
    {"instruction": "What is the time complexity of finding an element in a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)?", "response": "The time complexity is O(log n). Because the tree is balanced, the height of the tree is log(n), and each comparison allows the algorithm to skip half of the remaining nodes."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the space complexity of Quicksort.", "response": "The auxiliary space complexity of Quicksort is typically O(log n) due to the recursive stack frames. While it sorts 'in-place', the recursion depth for a balanced partition is log n. In the worst-case (unbalanced), it could be O(n)."},
    {"instruction": "What is the time complexity of building a heap from an array of n elements?", "response": "Although it looks like O(n log n), building a heap using the 'bottom-up' heapify method actually has a time complexity of O(n). This is because the work done decreases as you move up the tree toward the root."},
    {"instruction": "Order these complexities from fastest to slowest: O(n^3), O(1), O(n!), O(log n), O(n log n).", "response": "The order from fastest to slowest is: O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n^3), O(n!)."},
    {"instruction": "What does O(V + E) signify in graph algorithms like BFS or DFS?", "response": "O(V + E) represents linear time complexity relative to the size of the graph, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. It means the algorithm visits every vertex and explores every edge exactly once."},
    {"instruction": "If an algorithm's runtime is described by T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n, what is its Big O complexity according to the Master Theorem?", "response": "According to the Master Theorem, this corresponds to Case 2, where the work done at each level is equal to the work done in subproblems. The complexity is O(n log n)."},
    {"instruction": "What is the space complexity of an algorithm that uses an adjacency list to store a graph?", "response": "The space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because it stores a list for every vertex, and the total number of elements across all lists corresponds to the number of edges."}

It is useful when you have unfinished work on a branch but need to switch branches immediately to fix a bug or pull updates without committing incomplete code."},
    {"instruction": "Compare 'git merge' vs 'git rebase' for updating a feature branch.", "response": "git merge takes all the changes from the base branch and combines them into the feature branch in a single new 'merge commit,' preserving the chronological history and showing exactly when branches joined. git rebase moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit, effectively rewriting history so the feature branch appears to have started from the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a cleaner, linear project history."},
    {"instruction": "How do I undo the most recent commit that hasn't been pushed yet?", "response": "To undo the most recent commit while keeping your changes in the staging area, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1'. If you want to undo the commit and discard all changes entirely, use 'git reset --hard HEAD~1'."},
    {"instruction": "What is a 'detached HEAD' state in Git?", "response": "A detached HEAD state occurs when you check out a specific commit, tag, or remote branch instead of a local branch. In this state, the HEAD pointer points directly to a commit hash rather than a branch reference. Any new commits made in this state will not belong to any branch and may be lost if you switch branches without creating a new branch to save them."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Atomic Commits'.", "response": "Atomic commits is a strategy where each commit contains only one logical change or fix. This makes history easier to read, simplifies the process of reverting specific changes without affecting unrelated code, and makes code reviews more manageable because the intent of each commit is clear and focused."},
    {"instruction": "How can I change the commit message of the last commit?", "response": "You can use the command 'git commit --amend -m \"New commit message\"'. If you have already pushed the commit to a remote, you will need to 'git push --force' to update the remote history, which should be done with caution if others are working on the same branch."},
    {"instruction": "What is the purpose of the .gitignore file?", "response": "A .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files like build artifacts (e.g., /bin, /dist), dependency folders (e.g., node_modules), temporary system files (.DS_Store), and sensitive environment variables (.env) are typically included to keep the repository clean and secure."},
    {"instruction": "How does 'git cherry-pick' work and when is it useful?", "response": "git cherry-pick allows you to apply the changes introduced by an existing commit from one branch onto your current branch. It is useful when you want to port a specific bug fix or feature from one development line to another without merging the entire branch."},
    {"instruction": "What is a 'Fast-Forward' merge?", "response": "A fast-forward merge occurs when the base branch has not diverged from the feature branch being merged. Git simply moves the pointer of the base branch forward to the tip of the feature branch. No new merge commit is created because there is no divergent history to reconcile."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the 'Forking Workflow' commonly used in Open Source.", "response": "In the Forking Workflow, developers do not have write access to the main 'official' repository. Instead, they 'fork' (copy) the repository to their own account, make changes locally, and then submit a 'Pull Request' to the original repository. This allows maintainers to review contributions from anyone without granting direct access to the codebase."},
    {"instruction": "How can I see a log of all actions taken in a repository, including deleted commits?", "response": "You can use 'git reflog'. Unlike 'git log', which shows the commit history of the current branch, 'git reflog' tracks every time the HEAD pointer changed (swapping branches, committing, rebasing, etc.), allowing you to recover 'lost' commits that are no longer reachable by any branch or tag."},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between 'git reset' and 'git revert'?", "response": "git reset moves the current branch pointer to a previous commit, effectively 'deleting' history from that point forward (depending on flags). it is usually only safe for local branches. git revert creates a brand new commit that performs the exact opposite changes of a previous commit, essentially 'undoing' it while preserving the history, making it safe for shared/public branches."},
    {"instruction": "How do I view the differences between my working directory and the staging area?", "response": "You use the command 'git diff'. To view the differences between the staging area and the last commit, you use 'git diff --staged' (or 'git diff --cached')."},
    {"instruction": "What does 'git remote prune origin' do?", "response": "This command deletes local references to branches that have been deleted from the remote repository ('origin'). It helps keep your local list of remote branches clean by removing 'stale' tracking branches."},
    {"instruction": "How do you create and switch to a new branch in a single command?", "response": "You can use 'git checkout -b <branch-name>' or, in newer versions of Git, 'git switch -c <branch-name>'."},
    {"instruction": "Explain 'Trunk-Based Development'.", "response": "Trunk-Based Development is a strategy where all developers work on a single shared branch (the 'trunk' or 'main'). They commit small, frequent updates, avoiding long-lived feature branches. This minimizes merge hell and facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)."},
    {"instruction": "What is a Git Hook?", "response": "Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are stored in the .git/hooks directory and are used to automate development workflows, such as running linters or tests before allowing a commit to proceed (pre-commit hook)."}

 Response: [
    {"instruction": "What is the primary difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?", "response": "A Docker image is a read-only template containing the instructions for creating a container, including the application code, libraries, and dependencies. A Docker container is a runnable instance of an image. You can think of an image as a class in object-oriented programming and a container as an instance of that class."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the 'EXPOSE' instruction in a Dockerfile.", "response": "The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It serves as documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container. It does not actually publish the port; to do that, you must use the -p or -P flag when running the container."},
    {"instruction": "How do you remove all stopped containers with a single command?", "response": "You can use the command 'docker container prune' to remove all stopped containers. To skip the confirmation prompt, you can add the -f or --force flag."},
    {"instruction": "What is the 'copy-on-write' strategy in Docker storage?", "response": "Copy-on-write (CoW) is an optimization strategy where if a process needs to modify a file in a lower image layer, Docker copies the file to the top writable layer before making the change. This keeps the underlying image layers immutable and allows multiple containers to share the same underlying image layers efficiently."},
    {"instruction": "Write a basic Dockerfile for a Node.js application.", "response": "FROM node:18-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY package*.json ./\\nRUN npm install\\nCOPY . .\\nEXPOSE 3000\\nCMD [\\\"node\\\", \\\"index.js\\\"]"},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between the 'RUN', 'CMD', and 'ENTRYPOINT' instructions?", "response": "RUN executes commands during the image build process and creates new layers. CMD provides default arguments for an executing container and can be easily overridden by command-line arguments. ENTRYPOINT configures a container to run as an executable; while it can be overridden, it is intended to define the main command that always runs when the container starts."},
    {"instruction": "How do you mount a host directory into a container as a volume?", "response": "You use the -v or --volume flag followed by the host path, a colon, and the container path. For example: 'docker run -v /home/user/data:/app/data my-image'. Alternatively, the --mount flag is more verbose but preferred for clarity: 'docker run --mount type=bind,source=/home/user/data,target=/app/data my-image'."},
    {"instruction": "What is Docker Compose and when should you use it?", "response": "Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. It should be used when an application requires multiple interdependent services, such as a web frontend, a backend API, and a database, allowing them to be started with a single 'docker-compose up' command."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the 'bridge' network mode in Docker.", "response": "The bridge network is the default network driver for containers. When you start a container without specifying a network, it joins the default bridge network. It allows containers on the same bridge to communicate via IP addresses, but provides isolation from the host network and other bridge networks. Containers on the bridge can be accessed from the outside world by mapping ports."},
    {"instruction": "What does the 'docker-compose.yml' 'depends_on' field do?", "response": "The 'depends_on' field expresses startup and shutdown dependencies between services. For example, if a backend service depends on a database, Docker Compose will start the database before the backend. However, it does not wait for the database to be 'ready' (e.g., accepting connections), only for the container to start. Health checks are often needed for full readiness coordination."},
    {"instruction": "How can you view the logs of a container that crashed during startup?", "response": "You can use the 'docker logs [container_id_or_name]' command. Even if a container has exited, its logs remain available on the host until the container is explicitly removed."},
    {"instruction": "What is a multi-stage build and why is it useful?", "response": "Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. You can use a large image with build tools to compile your code, then copy only the resulting binary into a much smaller production image (like Alpine). This significantly reduces the final image size and improves security by removing unnecessary build tools."},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between 'docker stop' and 'docker kill'?", "response": "docker stop' sends a SIGTERM signal to the container's main process, allowing it to perform cleanup before exiting gracefully. If it doesn't stop within a grace period, a SIGKILL is sent. 'docker kill' sends SIGKILL immediately, forcing the container to stop without cleanup."},
    {"instruction": "How do you share an environment variable with a container at runtime?", "response": "You can use the -e or --env flag. For example: 'docker run -e MY_VAR=secret_value my-image'. You can also point to an environment file using the --env-file flag."},
    {"instruction": "What is the role of the Docker Daemon (dockerd)?", "response": "The Docker Daemon is a persistent background process that manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests from the Docker CLI and performs the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing containers."},
    {"instruction": "How can you execute a command inside a container that is already running?", "response": "You use the 'docker exec' command. For an interactive shell, the syntax is 'docker exec -it [container_id_or_name] /bin/bash' (or /bin/sh for lightweight images)."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Dangling Images'.", "response": "A dangling image is an image that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container. This usually happens when you build a new version of an image with the same tag as an existing one; the old image becomes 'untagged' and is listed as <none>:<none>. They can be cleaned up using 'docker image prune'."},
    {"instruction": "What is the purpose of a .dockerignore file?", "response": "A .dockerignore file is used to exclude files and directories from the build context sent to the Docker daemon. This speeds up the build process and prevents sensitive files (like .git, node_modules, or .env files) from being accidentally included in the image layers."},
    {"instruction": "What are Docker Secrets and how do they differ from environment variables?", "response": "Docker Secrets (primarily used in Swarm mode) are a secure way to store and manage sensitive data like passwords or SSH keys. Unlike environment variables, which are often visible in process listings or logs, secrets are encrypted during transit and at rest, and are mounted as files in a temporary in-memory filesystem (tmpfs) within the container."},
    {"instruction": "How do you limit the CPU and Memory usage of a container?", "response": "You can use resource constraint flags during 'docker run'. For memory, use '--memory=\"512m\"' to limit the container to 512 megabytes. For CPU, use '--cpus=\"1.5\"' to limit the container to one and a half CPU cores."}

 Response: [
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between a SyntaxError and an AttributeError in Python?", "response": "A SyntaxError occurs when the Python interpreter cannot parse the code because it violates the rules of the language grammar, such as missing colons or unbalanced parentheses. An AttributeError occurs at runtime when you attempt to access an attribute or method on an object that does not possess it, such as calling .append() on a dictionary."},
    {"instruction": "How do I use the 'try-except-finally' block to manage file resources safely?", "response": "The 'try' block contains the code that might raise an exception, the 'except' block catches and handles specific errors, and the 'finally' block executes code regardless of whether an error occurred or not. This is often used for cleanup, such as closing a file: \n\nf = open('data.txt', 'r')\ntry:\n    content = f.read()\nexcept IOError as e:\n    print(f'Error reading file: {e}')\nfinally:\n    f.close()"},
    {"instruction": "Explain how to set a breakpoint using the built-in 'breakpoint()' function.", "response": "Introduced in Python 3.7, calling 'breakpoint()' in your code drops you into the configured debugger (usually pdb). It is functionally equivalent to 'import pdb; pdb.set_trace()'. Once the interpreter hits this line, execution pauses, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code execution line by line in the terminal."},
    {"instruction": "What is the 'traceback' module used for in Python debugging?", "response": "The 'traceback' module provides a standard interface to extract, format, and print stack traces of Python programs. It is particularly useful when you want to log the full history of a call stack leading to an error without necessarily crashing the program, allowing for better post-mortem analysis in production logs."},
    {"instruction": "How do I catch multiple specific exceptions in a single 'except' block?", "response": "You can catch multiple exceptions by passing them as a tuple to the except clause. For example: 'try: ... except (ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e: ...'. This allows you to handle several different error types using the same recovery logic."},
    {"instruction": "What are 'f-string' debugging expressions introduced in Python 3.8?", "response": "Python 3.8 introduced the '=' specifier within f-strings to simplify print-debugging. For example, 'print(f\"{user_id=}\")' will output 'user_id=123', showing both the variable name and its value, which reduces typing and errors during quick debugging sessions."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the purpose of 'raise from' syntax in exception handling.", "response": "The 'raise NewException from OldException' syntax is used for exception chaining. It explicitly links a new exception to a previous one, allowing the developer to see the original cause (the 'cause' attribute) in the traceback. This is useful when you want to wrap a low-level error into a more meaningful high-level application error."},
    {"instruction": "How can I check the type of an object during a debugging session?", "response": "You can use the 'type()' function or 'isinstance()' function. In a debugger like pdb or an interactive shell, typing 'type(variable_name)' returns the class of the object, while 'isinstance(variable_name, target_type)' returns a boolean indicating if the object is an instance of that type or a subclass."},
    {"instruction": "What does the 'pdb' command 'n' (next) do compared to 's' (step)?", "response": "In the pdb debugger, 'n' (next) executes the current line and moves to the next line in the current function, effectively skipping over function calls. 's' (step) will enter into any function call on the current line, allowing you to debug the internal logic of that called function."},
    {"instruction": "How do I suppress a specific exception using contextlib?", "response": "The 'contextlib.suppress' context manager can be used to ignore specified exceptions. For example: 'with contextlib.suppress(FileNotFoundError): os.remove(\"temp.txt\")'. This is cleaner than a try-except block when you intentionally want to ignore an error and take no action."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the importance of catching 'Exception' instead of 'BaseException'.", "response": "In Python, 'BaseException' is the root of the exception hierarchy and includes system-level events like KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) and SystemExit. You should catch 'Exception' because it covers almost all program-related errors while still allowing the user to interrupt the script via the keyboard."},
    {"instruction": "What is log-level configuration and how does it help in debugging?", "response": "The 'logging' module allows you to categorise messages by severity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. By setting the level (e.g., logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)), you can see verbose output during development, but then restrict it to only ERROR or CRITICAL in production by changing a single configuration value."},
    {"instruction": "How can I debug a memory leak in a Python application?", "response": "Memory leaks can be debugged using tools like 'tracemalloc' to track memory allocations, 'objgraph' to visualize object references and find cycles, or 'gc.get_objects()' to inspect the current objects in memory. These tools help identify which objects are not being garbage collected as expected."},
    {"instruction": "What is an 'AssertionError' and when should it be used?", "response": "An 'AssertionError' is raised when an 'assert' statement fails. It should be used to check for internal program invariants or conditions that should 'never' happen if the code is correct. Assertions can be globally disabled with the -O flag, so they should not be used for data validation or business logic."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the 'Identity' vs 'Equality' check in the context of bug finding.", "response": "Bugs often occur when using 'is' (identity) instead of '==' (equality). '==' checks if values are the same, while 'is' checks if two variables point to the same memory address. For example, 'a = [1]; b = [1]' results in 'a == b' being True, but 'a is b' being False."},
    {"instruction": "How do you profile code performance to find bottlenecks?", "response": "You can use the 'cProfile' module to get detailed statistics on function call frequency and execution time. For example, running 'python -m cProfile script.py' will output a table showing where your program spends most of its time, helping you focus debugging on slow sections."},
    {"instruction": "What is the 'vars()' function and how is it useful for debugging?", "response": "The 'vars()' function returns the '__dict__' attribute of an object, which contains its writable attributes. When called without arguments, it acts like 'locals()'. It is highly useful for inspecting the entire state of an object or the local scope at a specific point in execution."},
    {"instruction": "How do I handle exceptions that occur inside a generator?", "response": "Exceptions in a generator can be handled using 'try-except' inside the yield loop. Additionally, the caller of the generator can use the '.throw()' method to raise an exception inside the generator function at the point where it is currently suspended."},
    {"instruction": "What are custom exceptions and why define them?", "response": "Custom exceptions are classes created by inheriting from the built-in 'Exception' class. They should be defined to provide more specific error information to the caller and to allow users of your library to catch your specific errors without catching all generic errors, making the code more robust and readable."},
    {"instruction": "How can you use the 'inspect' module to debug call stacks?", "response": "The 'inspect' module provides functions like 'inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())' or 'inspect.stack()'. These allow you to programmatically access information about the current function's caller, the source file name, and the line number, which is useful for building custom logging or debugging wrappers."}

 Response: [
    {"instruction": "What is the primary difference between relational and NoSQL databases regarding schema flexibility?", "response": "Relational databases use a rigid, predefined schema where data must fit into tables with specific columns and data types before it can be stored. This ensures consistency but makes changes difficult. NoSQL databases provide flexible schemas, often allowing documents or key-value pairs to store varied data structures without a central definition, making them better for evolving data requirements."},
    {"instruction": "Compare the scaling mechanisms of RDMS and NoSQL systems.", "response": "Relational databases (RDBMS) typically scale vertically by increasing the CPU, RAM, or storage of a single server. While horizontal scaling is possible through sharding, it is complex. NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling (scaling out) from the ground up, distributing data across multiple commodity servers to handle massive increases in traffic and volume naturally."},
    {"instruction": "Under what circumstances should I choose a relational database over a NoSQL option?", "response": "You should choose a relational database when your data structure is stable and fits well into rows and columns, when complex join operations are required across multiple tables, and when strict ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is non-negotiable, such as in financial transaction systems."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the CAP theorem in the context of NoSQL databases.", "response": "The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Since network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, NoSQL databases usually trade off either Consistency (choosing AP for high availability) or Availability (choosing CP for strong consistency)."},
    {"instruction": "Why are NoSQL databases often considered better for 'Big Data' applications?", "response": "NoSQL databases excel in Big Data scenarios because they can handle massive volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide high-speed write/read performance. Their ability to scale horizontally across hundreds of nodes allows them to process petabytes of data that would exceed the capacity of a traditional single-instance relational database."},
    {"instruction": "What is 'impedance mismatch' and how does NoSQL address it?", "response": "Impedance mismatch refers to the friction between the object-oriented models used in application code and the tabular format of relational databases. NoSQL databases, particularly document stores like MongoDB, address this by storing data in formats that closely resemble application objects (like JSON), reducing the need for translation layers or complex ORMs."},
    {"instruction": "Describe the trade-off regarding Joins in NoSQL vs Relational databases.", "response": "Relational databases support powerful SQL JOIN operations that allow for normalized data storage and complex querying across tables. NoSQL databases typically do not support server-side joins; instead, data is often denormalized (duplicated) or joins must be performed manually in application code, which optimizes for read speed at the cost of data redundancy."},
    {"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Strong Consistency' and 'Eventual Consistency'?", "response": "Strong consistency, common in relational databases, ensures that a read following a write always returns the most recent data. Eventual consistency, common in many NoSQL systems, allows for temporary discrepancies between nodes, focusing on high availability; eventually, all updates propagate and all nodes will see the same data."},
    {"instruction": "How do indexing strategies differ between SQL and NoSQL?", "response": "In SQL, indexes are highly structured and help optimize complex queries across multiple columns, but can slow down write performance significantly. NoSQL databases often use unique indexing strategies like B-trees (document stores), LSM-trees (wide-column), or specialized search indexes to maintain performance at scale, though they may support fewer secondary indexes than RDBMS."},
    {"instruction": "Which database type is better for a social media feed? Why?", "response": "A NoSQL database, specifically a document or graph store, is often better for a social media feed. Document stores handle varied post content (text, images, polls) well, while graph databases efficiently manage complex relationships like 'friends of friends' and 'followers' which are computationally expensive in relational systems."},
    {"instruction": "Is ACID compliance possible in NoSQL databases?", "response": "Yes, but with caveats. While many NoSQL databases prioritize BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency), some modern NoSQL systems like MongoDB and Cassandra have introduced support for ACID transactions, though often limited to a single document or partition rather than the global, cross-table ACID guarantees found in RDBMS."},
    {"instruction": "What are the storage costs associated with denormalization in NoSQL?", "response": "Denormalization involves duplicating data to avoid joins. This increases the total storage footprint and creates the risk of data inconsistency, as an update to a single piece of information must be performed in multiple locations. However, it results in much faster read performance since all necessary data is located in a single record."},
    {"instruction": "Compare the query languages used by both systems.", "response": "Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language), a standardized and powerful declarative language for complex queries. NoSQL databases use various methods, including UnQL, specialized APIs (like MongoDB's MQL), or graph traversal languages like Cypher or Gremlin, which are often more optimized for specific data models but lack a universal standard."},
    {"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Polyglot Persistence'.", "response": "Polyglot Persistence is an architectural approach where an application uses multiple database technologies to solve different problems. For example, using a relational database for user accounts and billing, a NoSQL document store for product catalogs, and Redis for caching and session management."},
    {"instruction": "What is a 'Wide-Column Store' and when is it preferable to a relational database?", "response": "A Wide-Column store, like Cassandra or HBase, stores data in rows but allows for an enormous number of dynamic columns. It is preferable to a relational database when you have massive datasets (petabytes) and need to perform high-frequency writes and simple lookups across distributed clusters where high availability is critical."},
    {"instruction": "How do relational databases handle high-concurrency write operations compared to NoSQL?", "response": "Relational databases often struggle with very high-concurrency writes due to locking mechanisms required for ACID compliance. NoSQL databases, especially those using log-structured merge-trees (LSM), are optimized for high-throughput writes by appending data to logs and merging it later, though this can sometimes impact read latency."},
    {"instruction": "Why might a startup choose NoSQL during the initial development phase?", "response": "Startups often choose NoSQL because the flexible schema allows them to pivot and change their data model quickly without performing expensive and risky database migrations or downtime, which facilitates faster iteration and prototyping."},
    {"instruction": "What are the drawbacks of using a NoSQL database for financial reporting?", "response": "NoSQL is often poor for financial reporting because reporting requires complex aggregations, multi-table joins, and perfect data accuracy. The eventual consistency and lack of cross-record transactional integrity in many NoSQL systems could lead to reporting errors or significantly more complex application logic to ensure data correctness."},
    {"instruction": "What role does a 'Graph Database' play in the NoSQL vs Relational debate?", "response": "Graph databases (a type of NoSQL) focus on the relationships between data points as first-class citizens. While a relational database uses foreign keys and join tables to link data, which becomes slow as deep hierarchies grow, graph databases allow for nearly instantaneous traversal of complex networks, making them superior for recommendation engines and fraud detection."},

 Response: [
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the high-level intuition behind backpropagation in a neural network.",
    "response": "Backpropagation is essentially 'learning from mistakes.' After a network makes a prediction (forward pass), we calculate how far off it was using a loss function. Backpropagation then works backward from the output layer to the input layer, calculating how much each weight and bias contributed to that error. It uses the chain rule from calculus to determine the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter, allowing the network to update its weights in the direction that reduces the error."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the role of the chain rule in the backpropagation algorithm?",
    "response": "The chain rule is the mathematical engine of backpropagation. Since a neural network is a composition of nested functions (layer after layer), the chain rule allows us to calculate the derivative of the final loss with respect to a weight in an early layer by multiplying the partial derivatives of each intermediate step. Specifically, dLoss/dWeight = (dLoss/dOutput) * (dOutput/dActivation) * (dActivation/dWeight)."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Define 'Gradient Descent' and how it relates to backpropagation.",
    "response": "Gradient Descent is the optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function, while backpropagation is the method used to calculate the gradients needed for that optimization. Once backpropagation provides the partial derivatives (the gradient), gradient descent subtracts a fraction of that gradient (scaled by the learning rate) from the current weights to move the model toward a local minimum of the loss surface."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Why do we need an activation function like ReLU or Sigmoid for backpropagation to work effectively?",
    "response": "Activation functions introduce non-linearity, which allows the network to learn complex patterns. From a backpropagation perspective, they must be differentiable so that we can calculate the gradient. Without a non-linear activation function, multiple layers would mathematically collapse into a single linear transformation, rendering the depth of the network useless regardless of the backpropagation steps."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What happens during the 'Forward Pass' vs the 'Backward Pass'?",
    "response": "In the forward pass, input data travels through the layers, being multiplied by weights and passed through activation functions until an output is generated and the loss is calculated. In the backward pass, we start at the loss value and apply the chain rule in reverse to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to every weight and bias in the network, preparing them for an update."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the 'Vanishing Gradient' problem?",
    "response": "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients become extremely small as they are propagated back to the earlier layers. This usually happens with activation functions like Sigmoid or Tanh, where the derivative is very small for large inputs. When you multiply many small derivatives together via the chain rule, the gradient effectively shrinks to zero, preventing the early layers from updating their weights and stalling the learning process."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does the choice of loss function affect backpropagation?",
    "response": "The loss function determines the starting point of the backward pass. The derivative of the loss function with respect to the network's output is the first term calculated in the chain rule sequence. For example, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy produce different gradient magnitudes and directions, which dictates how aggressively the weights are adjusted for specific types of errors."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Does backpropagation update the biases as well as the weights?",
    "response": "Yes, backpropagation treats biases similarly to weights. During the backward pass, the partial derivative of the loss with respect to each bias is calculated. Since a bias is simply an additive term in the linear step (z = wx + b), its local derivative (dz/db) is 1, making its gradient equal to the upstream gradient (dL/dz)."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the term 'Stochastic Gradient Descent' (SGD) in the context of backpropagation.",
    "response": "In standard gradient descent, backpropagation is performed on the entire dataset before updating weights. In SGD, backpropagation is performed after every single training example. This makes the updates noisier but faster and can help the model escape local minima by introducing stochasticity into the optimization path."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is 'Exploding Gradient' and how can it be mitigated?",
    "response": "Exploding gradients occur when large weight values and certain activations cause gradients to grow exponentially during the backward pass, leading to massive weight updates that make the model unstable. It is often mitigated using Gradient Clipping (capping the maximum value of the gradient) or Weight Initialization techniques like He or Xavier initialization."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does the learning rate hyperparameter influence the results of backpropagation?",
    "response": "The learning rate is a scalar that multiplies the gradient calculated by backpropagation. If the rate is too high, the updates will be too large, potentially overshooting the optimal values and causing divergence. If the rate is too low, the network will learn very slowly and might get stuck in a suboptimal local minimum or plateau."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe the backpropagation process in a single-layer perceptron.",
    "response": "In a single-layer perceptron, backpropagation is straightforward. We take the derivative of the loss with respect to the output, multiply it by the derivative of the activation function, and then multiply by the input vector. This direct calculation provides the gradient for the weights immediately, as there are no hidden layers to propagate through."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain how backpropagation handles 'weights sharing' in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).",
    "response": "In CNNs, the same filter (weights) is applied to different parts of the input. During backpropagation, the gradient for a shared weight is the sum of the gradients calculated for every position where that weight was used. This ensures that the filter learns features that are useful across the entire spatial range of the input."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the computational complexity of backpropagation?",
    "response": "The computational complexity of backpropagation is roughly proportional to the number of weights in the network, or O(W). Because the backward pass requires essentially the same number of operations as the forward pass (just with different values), it is highly efficient and scales linearly with the size of the model and the training data."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Why is the derivative of the activation function important during backpropagation?",
    "response": "The derivative of the activation function acts as a 'gate' for the gradient. If the derivative is zero (like in the flat regions of a Sigmoid or the negative side of a ReLU), the gradient is blocked from flowing back to earlier layers. This is why choosing functions with healthy derivatives is crucial for training deep architectures."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is 'Backpropagation Through Time' (BPTT)?",
    "response": "BPTT is the application of backpropagation to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since RNNs process sequences, the network is 'unrolled' in time, creating a series of identical layers. Backpropagation is then applied across these time steps, and the gradients for the shared weights are summed up across all time points to update the recurrent parameters."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do momentum-based optimizers use the output of backpropagation?",
    "response": "Optimizers like Momentum or Adam don't just use the current gradient from backpropagation; they keep a running average of previous gradients. Momentum adds a fraction of the previous update to the current one, helping the optimization process build 'velocity' in the correct direction and dampening oscillations in noisy dimensions."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can backpropagation work with non-differentiable functions?",
    "response": "Standard backpropagation requires differentiable functions because it relies on the chain rule. However, for functions that are mostly differentiable but have 'kinks' (like ReLU at x=0), we use sub-gradients. For truly non-differentiable functions (like a step function), we often use approximations or specialized techniques like the straight-through estimator."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What role does the 'Local Gradient' play in backpropagation?",
    "response": "A local gradient is the derivative of a node's output with respect to its inputs, calculated during the forward pass and stored. During the backward pass, backpropagation multiplies the 'upstream gradient' (coming from the layers above) by this 'local gradient' to calculate the 'downstream gradient' for the layers below."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does Batch Normalization affect the backpropagation process?",
    "response": "Batch Normalization stabilizes the distribution of inputs to a layer, which typically makes the gradients more predictable and prevents them from becoming too small or too large. During backpropagation, we must also propagate the gradient through the normalization calculations (mean and variance), which adds more steps to the chain rule but results in a smoother loss landscape."
