[{"instruction": "Explain what encapsulation is in Python OOP and provide a simple example.", "response": "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data. In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using private and protected access modifiers (conventionally using a single underscore `_` for protected and double underscore `__` for private).\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self.__balance = balance  # private attribute\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.__balance += amount\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.__balance\n\naccount = BankAccount(1000)\naccount.deposit(500)\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n# Direct access would cause an AttributeError: print(account.__balance)\n```"}, {"instruction": "How does Python implement inheritance? Show a base class and a derived class.", "response": "Inheritance allows a class (derived/child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base/parent class), promoting code reusability and establishing a relationship. In Python, inheritance is specified by placing the parent class name in parentheses after the child class name.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Some sound\"\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n        super().__init__(name)  # Call parent's __init__\n        self.breed = breed\n\n    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\ndog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\nprint(dog.name)    # Output: Buddy\nprint(dog.speak()) # Output: Woof!\n```"}, {"instruction": "What is polymorphism in Python? Give an example using a function that takes different object types.", "response": "Polymorphism means 'many forms'. In OOP, it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding (inheritance) or duck typing (if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck).\n\nExample using a function with different classes:\n\n```python\nclass Cat:\n    def sound(self):\n        return \"Meow\"\n\nclass Car:\n    def sound(self):\n        return \"Vroom\"\n\ndef make_sound(obj):\n    print(obj.sound())\n\nmake_sound(Cat())  # Output: Meow\nmake_sound(Car())  # Output: Vroom\n```\n\nHere, `make_sound` is polymorphic; it works with any object that has a `sound()` method."}, {"instruction": "Describe abstraction in Python OOP with a practical example.", "response": "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps reduce programming complexity and effort. In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `abc` module, which define methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass Shape(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def area(self):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def perimeter(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Rectangle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n\n    def area(self):\n        return self.width * self.height\n\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n\nrect = Rectangle(5, 3)\nprint(f\"Area: {rect.area()}\")        # Output: Area: 15\nprint(f\"Perimeter: {rect.perimeter()}\") # Output: Perimeter: 16\n```\n\nYou cannot instantiate `Shape` directly; it serves as a blueprint."}, {"instruction": "How do you use class methods and static methods in Python?

To refer to the instance's own attributes and methods.\n2. To differentiate between instance variables and local variables.\n3. It is passed implicitly when you call a method on an instance.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name  # instance attribute\n        self.age = age\n\n    def introduce(self):\n        return f\"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.\"\n\nperson1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nprint(person1.introduce())  # Output: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 30 years old.\n```\n\nWhen `person1.introduce()` is called, `person1` is automatically passed as `self`."}, {"instruction": "What are dunder methods in Python? Give examples of __init__, __str__, and __len__.", "response": "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores. They are also called magic methods.

Confirm and suggest improvements, and also explain if this approach fully mitigates account takeover risks from automated attacks using credential lists.", "response": "Rate-limiting login attempts is a valuable defense against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks, but setting it at 100 attempts per hour per IP is overly permissive and inadequate for security. Industry best practices recommend stricter limits, such as 5-10 failed attempts per 15-30 minutes before triggering an account lockout or CAPTCHA. However, IP-based rate-limiting alone does not fully mitigate account takeover risks, because attackers can bypass it using distributed botnets with numerous IP addresses, proxies, or VPNs. To improve: 1. Implement account-level lockouts (e.g., temporary lock after 5 failures) alongside IP limits to directly protect accounts. 2. Integrate CAPTCHA or multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges after a few failed attempts to disrupt automation. 3. Employ credential screening to reject passwords known to be compromised in breaches. 4. Monitor for patterns like many failed logins across multiple accounts from a single IP or rapid attempts from diverse IPs targeting one account. 5. Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection services to handle volumetric attacks, as rate-limiting alone is insufficient for large-scale DDoS. Remember, a layered security approach combining these measures is essential to effectively reduce risks from credential stuffing and automated attacks."}

Keep small and focused: Break large features into smaller increments that can be completed and merged independently.\n2. Integrate frequently: Regularly rebase or merge the target branch (e.g., main) into your feature branch to reduce drift and avoid massive conflicts.\n3. Feature flags: Use toggles to merge incomplete features behind a flag so code can land in main safely and be enabled later.\n4. Continuous Integration: Ensure CI runs on the feature branch so regressions are caught early.\n5. Communication: Coordinate with other developers about design changes and APIs to avoid conflicting assumptions.\n6. Prefer short-lived branches: Aim for branches that live days or, at most, a few weeks. If a branch becomes long-running, consider splitting or merging partial work.\n7. Use isolated integration branches: If multiple developers work on a larger feature, create a short-lived integration branch to collect their work and run integration tests before merging to main.\n8. Clean history before merge: Use interactive rebase or squash to produce a coherent commit history when merging, according to team policy.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Long-lived branches can isolate work but increase merge complexity and delay feedback.\n- Techniques like feature flags and trunk-based development are often used to avoid long-lived branches altogether."}

Disagree and explain the risk.", "response": "Using `eval()` on user-provided input, even from \"trusted\" users (like internal admins), is extremely dangerous and should be avoided. `eval()` executes any JavaScript code with the same privileges as your application. Risks include: 1. If an admin account is compromised, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution. 2. Accidental mistakes in the configuration could break the application. 3. It violates the principle of least privilege and separation of data/code. Instead, use safer alternatives: 1. A structured configuration format (JSON, YAML) parsed by a safe parser. 2. A custom, limited domain-specific language (DSL) for configuration. 3. Sandboxed execution environments if dynamic code is absolutely necessary (though still risky). Never pass user input to `eval()`, `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with strings, `new Function()`, or `innerHTML` without proper sanitization."}

2026-02-27 00:02:09,299: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common Python debugging techniques and error handling".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

Important notes: KeyboardInterrupt inherits from BaseException, so except Exception: will NOT catch it; a bare except: will catch it but is unsafe because it also hides SystemExit and other critical errors. Recommended pattern:\n\ntry:\n    # start servers, threads, or event loop\n    main()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    logging.info(\"Received Ctrl-C, shutting down...\")\n    # notify workers to stop (e.g. set an Event)\n    shutdown_event.set()\n    # join threads or stop servers cleanly\n    for t in threads:\n        t.join(timeout=5)\n    cleanup_resources()\n    sys.exit(0)\nexcept Exception as exc:\n    logging.exception(\"Unhandled exception\")\n    cleanup_resources()\n    sys.exit(1)\nfinally:\n    # last-resort cleanup if needed\n    cleanup_resources()\n\nFor multithreaded programs: use a threading.Event as a shutdown flag that worker threads poll; avoid relying on daemon threads for cleanup if you need to close resources. For signal-based shutdown (Unix): install a signal handler in the main thread that sets the same Event (signal.signal or loop.add_signal_handler for asyncio). For asyncio: register signal handlers, cancel outstanding tasks, and await graceful shutdown of coroutines. Always prefer context managers (with open(...), with socket...) or finally blocks to guarantee resource release, log the shutdown steps, and return an appropriate exit code. This approach ensures a predictable, testable graceful shutdown on Ctrl-C."

2026-02-27 00:02:19,311: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "We use `eval()` in our JavaScript to dynamically execute user-provided configuration snippets because it's flexible. As long as we trust our users, it's fine. Disagree and explain the risk.", "response": "Using `eval()` on user-provided input, even from \"trusted\" users (like internal admins), is extremely dangerous and should be avoided. `eval()` executes any JavaScript code with the same privileges as your application. Risks include: 1. If an admin account is compromised, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution. 2. Accidental mistakes in the configuration could break the application. 3. It violates the principle of least privilege and separation of data/code. Instead, use safer alternatives: 1. A structured configuration format (JSON, YAML) parsed by a safe parser. 2. A custom, limited domain-specific language (DSL) for configuration. 3. Sandboxed execution environments if dynamic code is absolutely necessary (though still risky). Never pass user input to `eval()`, `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with strings, `new Function()`, or `innerHTML` without proper sanitization."}

Please explain the vulnerabilities we're overlooking.",
        "response": "Allowing unrestricted file uploads without validation is a severe security vulnerability known as Unrestricted File Upload. Even if you trust users, attackers can exploit this to compromise your server. Risks include: 1. **Malicious File Execution**: An attacker could upload a script (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.asp`) to a web-accessible directory and execute it, leading to remote code execution, data theft, or server takeover. 2. **Client-Side Attacks**: Uploaded HTML/JS files could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) or phishing if served to other users. 3. **Denial of Service**: Large files or numerous uploads can exhaust disk space or bandwidth. 4. **Malware Distribution**: The server could inadvertently host malware. Mitigations: 1. **Validate file type**: Check both the file extension and MIME type, but also consider magic number validation for images. 2. **Rename files**: Use a random, safe filename (e.g., UUID) and avoid user-supplied names. 3. **Store outside web root**: Keep uploaded files in a non-public directory and serve them via a secure script that validates access. 4. **Limit file size and rate**. 5. **Scan for malware** if feasible. Never rely on client-side checks alone; always enforce strict server-side validation."

List other potential attack vectors related to data parsing.", "response": "While avoiding XML eliminates the XXE threat, other data formats and parsing mechanisms can introduce similar vulnerabilities. Be aware of: 1. Insecure Deserialization: When applications deserialize untrusted data (e.g., Java, .NET, Python pickle, PHP unserialize), it can lead to remote code execution or object injection. 2. JSON Injection: If user input is unsafely incorporated into JSON that is then evaluated as code (e.g., via `eval()`), it could lead to attacks, though less common than XSS. 3. Prototype Pollution: In JavaScript, merging user objects without safety can modify object prototypes, leading to security flaws. 4. YAML Parsers: Some YAML parsers (like PyYAML's `yaml.load`) can execute arbitrary code during deserialization; use `yaml.safe_load`. Always treat all untrusted data with caution, regardless of format, and use safe parsing functions that do not execute code."}

{"instruction": "How do you handle long-lived feature branches to minimize integration pain?", "response": "Strategies for managing long-lived feature branches:\n\n1. Keep small and focused: Break large features into smaller increments that can be completed and merged independently.\n2. Integrate frequently: Regularly rebase or merge the target branch (e.g., main) into your feature branch to reduce drift and avoid massive conflicts.\n3. Feature flags: Use toggles to merge incomplete features behind a flag so code can land in main safely and be enabled later.\n4. Continuous Integration: Ensure CI runs on the feature branch so regressions are caught early.\n5. Communication: Coordinate with other developers about design changes and APIs to avoid conflicting assumptions.\n6. Prefer short-lived branches: Aim for branches that live days or, at most, a few weeks. If a branch becomes long-running, consider splitting or merging partial work.\n7. Use isolated integration branches: If multiple developers work on a larger feature, create a short-lived integration branch to collect their work and run integration tests before merging to main.\n8. Clean history before merge: Use interactive rebase or squash to produce a coherent commit history when merging, according to team policy.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Long-lived branches can isolate work but increase merge complexity and delay feedback.\n- Techniques like feature flags and trunk-based development are often used to avoid long-lived branches altogether."}

Short branches reduce merge conflicts and speed feedback.\n\n2) Integrate frequently: pull updates from main regularly and rebase or merge to keep drift low. Example safe flow for a private feature branch:\n   git fetch origin\n   git rebase origin/main\n   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/XYZ\nAvoid rebasing branches that are already shared without coordination.\n\n3) Use feature flags: merge incomplete functionality behind toggles so code can land on main and be enabled later, enabling continuous delivery without long-lived isolation.\n\n4) Continuous Integration and gated merges: run CI on branch and PR, require passing tests and approvals before merging. Use build policies to prevent regressions.\n\n5) Small, focused PRs and regular reviews: split work into multiple pull requests, open draft PRs early to expose design and API changes, and request reviews often.\n\n6) Collaboration and communication: coordinate API and schema changes with other teams; document expected breakpoints and migration plans.\n\n7) Integration branches sparingly: if multiple developers must collaborate on a large feature, use a short-lived integration branch that aggregates work and runs integration tests before landing to main.\n\n8) Clean history per team policy: use squash merges for noisy WIP commits or interactive rebase to group logical commits. If you enforce a linear history, prefer rebasing before merge; otherwise, use merge commits.\n\n9) Conflict resolution tooling: enable git rerere to reuse prior conflict resolutions, and teach maintainers how to resolve conflicts locally and verify tests before pushing.\n\n10) Release strategy and rollbacks: pair long-lived development with canary releases, feature toggles, and a rollback plan. Protect main with branch protection rules, required status checks, and code owners.\n\nTrade-offs and when to accept long-lived branches: they can be useful for long-running experimental work or big refactors that cannot be decomposed, but they increase integration cost and delay feedback. If you must use them, enforce strict integration cadence, CI, and feature flags to mitigate pain."

 Response: [{"instruction":"Explain and demonstrate using typing.Protocol (PEP 544) to define structural interfaces for duck-typed classes in Python, including runtime_checkable, generics, practical examples, and how this relates to OOP principles like abstraction and polymorphism.","response":"Protocols (PEP 544) provide structural subtyping: you define an interface by listing required attributes and methods, and any object that provides those members is treated as implementing the interface without explicit inheritance. This supports OOP principles such as abstraction (defining behavior contracts) and polymorphism (different classes used interchangeably when they satisfy the protocol).\n\nKey points:\n- Structural (duck) typing: objects are compatible if they have the right shape.\n- Use typing.Protocol (or typing_extensions.Protocol on older Pythons).\n- @runtime_checkable allows isinstance/isinstance-like checks at runtime.\n- Protocols can be generic and include properties, methods, and attributes.\n- They help static type checkers (mypy, pyright) verify code without forcing inheritance.\n\nExample (Python 3.8+; use typing_extensions for older versions):\nfrom typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable, Any, TypeVar, Generic\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\n\nclass Serializer(Protocol):\n    def serialize(self, obj: Any) -> str: ...\n\nclass JsonSerializer:\n    def serialize(self, obj: Any) -> str:\n        import json\n        return json.dumps(obj)\n\nclass XmlSerializer:\n    def serialize(self, obj: Any) -> str:\n        return f'<data>{obj}</data>'\n\ndef save(obj: Any, serializer: Serializer) -> None:\n    s = serializer.serialize(obj)\n    print(s)\n\nsave({'a': 1}, JsonSerializer())\nsave('hello', XmlSerializer())\n\n# Generic protocol example for comparable objects\nclass Comparable(Protocol[T]):\n    def compare(self, other: T) -> int: ...\n\n# runtime_checkable allows runtime isinstance checks\n@runtime_checkable\nclass Closeable(Protocol):\n    def close(self) -> None: ...\n\nclass FileLike:\n    def close(self) -> None:\n        print('closed')\n\n# This returns True because FileLike has a close method and Closeable is runtime_checkable\nisinstance(FileLike(), Closeable)\n\nPractical notes:\n- Prefer Protocols when you want looser coupling than ABCs and you care about static type checking.\n- Use @runtime_checkable sparingly; most of Protocols' benefit is static checking rather than runtime enforcement.\n- Protocols align with the Interface Segregation Principle: define small focused protocols rather than large monolithic interfaces.\n- For libraries, document expected method signatures; Protocols make those contracts explicit to type checkers."}]

Decide on tagging policy and branch flow (e.g., releases come from main or release branches).\n2. When ready to release, create an annotated tag with the semantic version:\n   - git tag -a v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n3. Push the tag to remote: git push origin v1.2.3\n4. Automate release artifacts: CI/CD pipelines can watch for tags (or tags on protected branches) and build/publish releases.\n5. Maintain changelogs: Generate changelogs from commit messages or PR titles, typically using conventional commits to automate changelog generation.\n6. Incrementing policy:\n   - Use tooling or manual review to determine whether changes qualify for patch, minor, or major bumps.\n\nAutomation tips:\n- Use release tooling (GitHub Releases, semantic-release) to generate releases, publish packages, and update changelogs based on commits and tags.\n- Rely on annotated tags for releases so metadata and signatures are recorded."}

Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

        "response": "While avoiding XML does eliminate the classic XXE threat, it does not make your application immune to similar data parsing vulnerabilities. You must remain vigilant across all data formats. Key attack vectors include: 1. Insecure Deserialization: This is a critical risk when untrusted data is deserialized in languages like Java (with ObjectInputStream), .NET, Python (via pickle), or PHP (via unserialize). Attackers can achieve remote code execution, denial-of-service, or object injection. 2. JSON Injection and JSON-based attacks: If user input is directly concatenated into JSON strings that are then parsed with `eval()` or similar, it can lead to script execution (akin to XSS) in certain contexts, though modern parsers like `JSON.parse` are safer. However, misconfigurations in JSON parsers (e.g., enabling DTD processing in some libraries) can still lead to XXE-like issues even in JSON. 3. Prototype Pollution: In JavaScript, when user-controlled objects are merged into existing objects without proper sanitization, attackers can pollute the prototype chain, leading to security flaws such as remote code execution, property injection, or logic bypasses. 4. YAML Deserialization: Many YAML parsers (e.g., PyYAML's `yaml.load`, Ruby's Psych) can instantiate arbitrary objects during deserialization, leading to code execution. Always use safe alternatives like `yaml.safe_load`. 5. CSV Injection (Formula Injection): When exporting user-supplied data to CSV, formulas starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` can be interpreted by spreadsheet software, potentially leading to command execution or data exfiltration. 6. File Parsing Vulnerabilities: Parsing of uploaded files (like images, PDFs, Office documents) can trigger vulnerabilities in underlying libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, PDF readers), leading to remote code execution. To mitigate, always treat all untrusted data as potentially malicious, use strict input validation, employ allowlists for expected data structures, and utilize safe parsing functions that do not execute code or permit external entity references."

Prefer raising exceptions for truly incorrect or unsafe states that must be handled immediately.\n\nBest practices when emitting warnings:\n- Choose the appropriate category (DeprecationWarning, UserWarning, PendingDeprecationWarning, ResourceWarning, etc.). Note: DeprecationWarning is ignored by default for end users, so use UserWarning if you want it visible in normal runs.\n- Use stacklevel=2 (or higher) so the warning points at the caller site, e.g. warnings.warn('old_fn is deprecated, use new_fn', DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2).\n- Keep warning text actionable and short.\n\nExamples:\nimport warnings\n\ndef old_fn():\n    warnings.warn('old_fn is deprecated, use new_fn', DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\n\nHow to turn warnings into errors during tests or CI (so tests fail when a warning occurs):\n- pytest.ini approach:\n    [pytest]\n    filterwarnings = error::DeprecationWarning\n  This converts the specified warning class into an exception for all tests.\n\n- Per-test context using warnings.catch_warnings:\n    import warnings\n    import pytest\n\n    def test_no_deprecations():\n        with warnings.catch_warnings():\n            warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)\n            with pytest.raises(DeprecationWarning):\n                old_fn()\n\n- Use pytest helpers:\n    with pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning):\n        old_fn()\n  or to assert no warnings: use pytest.warns(None) as record and check record is empty.\n\n- Command-line / environment: run tests with Python -W error::DeprecationWarning or pytest -W error::DeprecationWarning to escalate warnings globally in CI.\n\n- Programmatic global change (use with caution):\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)\n\nTo inspect warnings without failing, use warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as rec and examine rec for categories and messages. In summary: use warnings for non-fatal signals, emit them with proper category and stacklevel, and configure your test/CI environment to treat relevant warnings as errors so regressions are caught early."

List other potential attack vectors related to data parsing.", "response": "While avoiding XML does eliminate the classic XXE threat, it does not make your application immune to similar data parsing vulnerabilities. You must remain vigilant across all data formats. Key attack vectors include: 1. Insecure Deserialization: This is a critical risk when untrusted data is deserialized in languages like Java (with ObjectInputStream), .NET, Python (via pickle), or PHP (via unserialize). Attackers can achieve remote code execution, denial-of-service, or object injection. 2. JSON Injection and JSON-based attacks: If user input is directly concatenated into JSON strings that are then parsed with `eval()` or similar, it can lead to script execution (akin to XSS) in certain contexts, though modern parsers like `JSON.parse` are safer. However, misconfigurations in JSON parsers (e.g., enabling DTD processing in some libraries) can still lead to XXE-like issues even in JSON. 3. Prototype Pollution: In JavaScript, when user-controlled objects are merged into existing objects without proper sanitization, attackers can pollute the prototype chain, leading to security flaws such as remote code execution, property injection, or logic bypasses. 4. YAML Deserialization: Many YAML parsers (e.g., PyYAML's `yaml.load`, Ruby's Psych) can instantiate arbitrary objects during deserialization, leading to code execution. Always use safe alternatives like `yaml.safe_load`. 5. CSV Injection (Formula Injection): When exporting user-supplied data to CSV, formulas starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` can be interpreted by spreadsheet software, potentially leading to command execution or data exfiltration. 6. File Parsing Vulnerabilities: Parsing of uploaded files (like images, PDFs, Office documents) can trigger vulnerabilities in underlying libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, PDF readers), leading to remote code execution. To mitigate, always treat all untrusted data as potentially malicious, use strict input validation, employ allowlists for expected data structures, and utilize safe parsing functions that do not execute code or permit external entity references."}

Correct this misunderstanding.", "response": "This is a severe misunderstanding with legal and security implications. First, hashing (even with SHA-256) is not encryption and is not suitable for storing primary account numbers (PANs) in a way that allows retrieval. Hashes are one-way; you cannot recover the original number for transactions. More critically, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) strictly prohibits storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization and imposes stringent requirements for PAN storage if needed. If storage is necessary, PCI DSS requires strong cryptography (e.g., AES-256) with robust key management. Furthermore, hashing without a salt allows attackers to use rainbow tables. You should minimize card data storage, use a certified payment processor that handles tokens, and ensure full PCI DSS compliance to avoid massive fines and breaches."}

Configure mypy with strictness suited to your codebase to find more issues early."}

2026-02-27 00:02:50,079: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Git workflow and version control strategies".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "What is semantic versioning and how can Git tags be used to implement it in a release process?", "response": "Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:\n- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.\n- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.\n- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n\nUsing Git tags with SemVer in release process:\n1. Decide on tagging policy and branch flow (e.g., releases come from main or release branches).\n2. When ready to release, create an annotated tag with the semantic version:\n   - git tag -a v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n3. Push the tag to remote: git push origin v1.2.3\n4. Automate release artifacts: CI/CD pipelines can watch for tags (or tags on protected branches) and build/publish releases.\n5. Maintain changelogs: Generate changelogs from commit messages or PR titles, typically using conventional commits to automate changelog generation.\n6. Incrementing policy:\n   - Use tooling or manual review to determine whether changes qualify for patch, minor, or major bumps.\n\nAutomation tips:\n- Use release tooling (GitHub Releases, semantic-release) to generate releases, publish packages, and update changelogs based on commits and tags.\n- Rely on annotated tags for releases so metadata and signatures are recorded."}

Typically, releases come from a protected main/master or a release branch.\n2) Tag releases with annotated (and optionally signed) tags so you record metadata and signatures:\n   - git tag -a v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n   - or signed: git tag -s v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n   - push tag: git push origin v1.2.3\n3) Use a consistent tag format (commonly a leading 'v' like vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Record in docs.\n4) Use protection and policies: protect the main branch and require PR reviews; restrict tag creation to CI or release managers if needed.\n5) Automation: configure CI/CD to react to tags (e.g., GitHub Actions: on: push: tags: ['v*']) to build artifacts, publish packages, and create release notes.\n6) Determine version bumps: adopt a commit convention (Conventional Commits) or a review policy to decide MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH. Tools like semantic-release, release-please, or standard-version can analyze commits and create tags automatically.\n7) Generate changelogs: derive changelogs from commit messages/PRs using conventional-changelog or built-in tooling in CI and attach them to the Git tag or GitHub Release.\n8) Pre-releases and hotfixes: publish pre-release tags for beta/rc (e.g., v1.3.0-rc.1). For hotfixes, create a patch branch from the current release tag, apply fix, tag, and publish.\n9) Best practices and cautions:\n   - Prefer annotated tags over lightweight tags to include author/date/message.\n   - Avoid force-moving published tags; tags are intended to be immutable. If you must change a tag, coordinate and explain the reason.\n   - Sign tags (GPG/SSH) for higher security and provenance where required.\n   - Keep a documented policy for version bump rules, tag naming, and release ownership.\n   - Use CI to produce reproducible artifacts tied to the tag commit hash so releases are traceable.\n\nExample automated flow: merge PR to main -> CI runs tests -> on success a maintainer or semantic-release increments version based on commits, creates an annotated signed tag (vX.Y.Z), CI detects tag push, builds artifacts, publishes package and GitHub Release with autogenerated changelog. This ensures reproducible, auditable, and consistent SemVer-based releases."

Typically, releases come from a protected main/master or a release branch.\n2) Tag releases with annotated (and optionally signed) tags so you record metadata and signatures:\n   - git tag -a v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n   - or signed: git tag -s v1.2.3 -m 'Release v1.2.3'\n   - push tag: git push origin v1.2.3\n3) Use a consistent tag format (commonly a leading 'v' like vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Record in docs.\n4) Use protection and policies: protect the main branch and require PR reviews; restrict tag creation to CI or release managers if needed.\n5) Automation: configure CI/CD to react to tags (e.g., GitHub Actions: on: push: tags: ['v*']) to build artifacts, publish packages, and create release notes.\n6) Determine version bumps: adopt a commit convention (Conventional Commits) or a review policy to decide MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH.

For hotfixes, create a patch branch from the current release tag, apply fix, tag, and publish.\n9) Best practices and cautions:\n   - Prefer annotated tags over lightweight tags to include author/date/message.\n   - Avoid force-moving published tags; tags are intended to be immutable. If you must change a tag, coordinate and explain the reason.\n   - Sign tags (GPG/SSH) for higher security and provenance where required.\n   - Keep a documented policy for version bump rules, tag naming, and release ownership.\n   - Use CI to produce reproducible artifacts tied to the tag commit hash so releases are traceable.\n\nExample automated flow: merge PR to main -> CI runs tests -> on success a maintainer or semantic-release increments version based on commits, creates an annotated signed tag (vX.Y.Z), CI detects tag push, builds artifacts, publishes package and GitHub Release with autogenerated changelog. This ensures reproducible, auditable, and consistent SemVer-based releases."}

If you must change a tag, coordinate and explain the reason.\n   - Sign tags (GPG/SSH) for higher security and provenance where required.\n   - Keep a documented policy for version bump rules, tag naming, and release ownership.\n   - Use CI to produce reproducible artifacts tied to the tag commit hash so releases are traceable.\n\nExample automated flow: merge PR to main -> CI runs tests -> on success a maintainer or semantic-release increments version based on commits, creates an annotated signed tag (vX.Y.Z), CI detects tag push, builds artifacts, publishes package and GitHub Release with autogenerated changelog. This ensures reproducible, auditable, and consistent SemVer-based releases."} with reason: The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' which results in a normalized score of 0.

2026-02-27 00:02:52,415: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "We rely on client-side validation in JavaScript for form inputs because it provides immediate user feedback. The server just trusts the data is valid. Point out the flaw and solution.", "response": "Relying solely on client-side validation is a major security flaw. Client-side validation can be easily bypassed by an attacker using tools like Burp Suite, curl, or by disabling JavaScript. The server must always perform its own validation, as it is the ultimate authority. Client-side validation is for user experience (immediate feedback) and reducing server load, but it provides no security. The solution is to implement identical, stringent validation rules on the server side. Treat all client-submitted data as untrusted and potentially malicious. Validate for type, length, format, range, and business rules. Use allow-lists (whitelists) where possible. Never trust data because it \"passed\" client-side checks."}

 Response: [

        "instruction": "We use client-side validation with JavaScript for immediate user feedback and to reduce server load. Since the client validation ensures proper data formats and length, the server-side code simply stores the submitted data in our database. Explain why this approach is fundamentally insecure and what the proper mitigation strategy should include.",
        "response": "This approach is fundamentally insecure because client-side validation is entirely under the control of the user and can be trivially bypassed. An attacker can disable JavaScript, modify the client-side code, or use tools like Burp Suite or curl to submit arbitrary, malicious data directly to your server endpoint. Since your server trusts and stores this data without its own validation, you are vulnerable to numerous attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and data corruption. The proper mitigation strategy is to implement defense in depth. First, treat all client-submitted data as untrusted and potentially malicious. Second, enforce robust server-side validation for every input parameter, checking for correct data type, allowed length, expected format (using strict regular expressions), valid range, and adherence to business rules. Prefer allow-listing (whitelisting) over block-listing. Third, complement validation with output encoding when displaying data and use parameterized queries for database access. Client-side validation should only be retained for improving user experience and reducing benign errors, not for security."

Require pull request reviews before merging: Ensure at least one or more approving reviews.\n2. Require status checks to pass: Block merges unless CI checks pass.\n3. Require up-to-date branch: Prevent merging if the branch is out-of-date with the base branch until it's updated (merge or rebase).\n4. Restrict who can push: Limit direct pushes to certain users or apps.\n5. Enforce signed commits: Require commits to be GPG-signed.\n6. Require linear history: Disallow merge commits and require rebase or squash merges.\n7. Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed.\n\nWhy they are important:\n- Improve code quality by ensuring reviews and CI are performed before merging.\n- Prevent accidental force-pushes or direct pushes that bypass PR workflows.\n- Protect critical branches from broken builds, regressions, or unauthorized changes.\n- Support compliance and auditability by keeping a clear, reviewable history.\n\nImplementation tips:\n- Start with basic protections (require PRs, CI checks) and iterate.\n- Communicate rules to the team and provide guidance on how to work within them (e.g., how to update branches that fail checks).\n- Avoid overly strict rules that hinder developer productivity; balance safety and speed."}

Assess this assumption.", "response": "This assumption is dangerously incorrect. Directory traversal (Path Traversal) vulnerabilities occur when user input (e.g., in a filename parameter like `../../etc/passwd`) is used to construct a filesystem path without proper sanitization. Even if your base directory is `/var/www/`, an attacker could use `../../../etc/passwd` to escape upward. The defense is to: 1. Avoid using user input in filesystem paths whenever possible. 2. If necessary, validate user input against a strict allow-list of permitted characters. 3. Canonicalize the path and ensure it remains within the intended directory (e.g., using a library function that checks the resolved path starts with your base directory). 4. Use indirect file mappings (e.g., a database ID) instead of direct filenames. Do not rely on the OS or absolute paths alone; implement explicit containment checks."}

2026-02-27 00:03:02,769: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common Python debugging techniques and error handling".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "How to use type hints and static analysis (mypy) to prevent bugs that show up at runtime?", "response": "Add type annotations to functions and run mypy (or Pyright) as part of CI to catch mismatches before runtime.\n\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    return \"Hello \" + name\n\n# mypy will flag passing an int: greet(5)\n\nUse gradual typing and add types to module boundaries and complex functions. Static typing doesn't replace runtime checks but reduces a class of bugs (wrong function calls, mismatched return types). Configure mypy with strictness suited to your codebase to find more issues early."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as per the metadata provided in the prompt, which triggers a critical fail and a 0.0 normalized score despite high quality dimensions.

        "instruction": "How to use type hints and static analysis (mypy) to prevent bugs that show up at runtime?",
        "response": "Use type hints to document and constrain interfaces, run a static checker like mypy (or Pyright) as part of local development and CI, and complement static checks with targeted runtime validation for critical boundaries.\n\nPractical steps:\n1) Add annotations at module boundaries and for complex functions:\n\ndef greet(name: str) -> str:\n    return \"Hello \" + name\n\n# mypy will flag: greet(5)\n\n2) Configure mypy gradually. Example mypy.ini:\n\n[mypy]\npython_version = 3.10\nignore_missing_imports = True\n# enable more checks as you progress\nstrict = True\n\nIf you can't enable strict globally, turn on flags incrementally (disallow_untyped_defs, check_untyped_defs, warn_unused_ignores).\n\n3) Integrate into CI and editors:\n- Run `mypy ./src` in CI or a GitHub Actions step.\n- Enable editor integration (VS Code, PyCharm) to see errors while coding.\n\n4) Use runtime guards for safety where static typing can't fully verify behavior:\n- typeguard or @typechecked to raise errors in tests or staging\n- pydantic/dataclasses for validated models\n\n5) Use TypedDict, Protocols and stubs for duck-typed or external libraries; install types- packages for third-party libs.\n\n6) Understand limitations: static analysis can't catch dynamic attribute creation, some reflection, or obfuscated runtime behavioruse unit tests, assertions, and logging to cover those.\n\nWorkflow tip: start by typing public APIs and core modules, add mypy to CI, then gradually increase strictness. Combine static typing with runtime checks and thorough tests to prevent the majority of type-related runtime bugs."

2026-02-27 00:03:12,870: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "We don't need to worry about directory traversal because our web server runs on Linux and we use absolute paths starting with `/var/www/`. Assess this assumption.", "response": "This assumption is dangerously incorrect. Directory traversal (Path Traversal) vulnerabilities occur when user input (e.g., in a filename parameter like `../../etc/passwd`) is used to construct a filesystem path without proper sanitization. Even if your base directory is `/var/www/`, an attacker could use `../../../etc/passwd` to escape upward. The defense is to: 1. Avoid using user input in filesystem paths whenever possible. 2. If necessary, validate user input against a strict allow-list of permitted characters. 3. Canonicalize the path and ensure it remains within the intended directory (e.g., using a library function that checks the resolved path starts with your base directory). 4. Use indirect file mappings (e.g., a database ID) instead of direct filenames. Do not rely on the OS or absolute paths alone; implement explicit containment checks."}

        "instruction": "We've configured our web app to accept user input for filenames and concatenate it with a base path like `/var/www/static/`. However, we're using a Node.js function that automatically normalizes the path, removing any `..` sequences before processing. Does this guarantee protection against directory traversal attacks?",
        "response": "Path normalization alone is insufficient. Many Node.js functions (e.g., `path.resolve()`, `path.normalize()`) do remove `..` sequences, but if the concatenated path is not validated after normalization, an attacker could still manipulate the input. For instance, an attacker might supply an absolute path like `/etc/passwd` or use URL-encoded sequences (`%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) that might bypass simple checks. Also, if the server resolves symbolic links, an attacker could potentially traverse outside the intended directory. The secure approach is to: 1. Use an allow-list of permitted file names or IDs, not user-supplied paths. 2. After normalization, verify the resolved path starts with the intended base directory using a strict string comparison (e.g., `resolvedPath.startsWith(basePath)`). 3. Consider using a secure file-serving library or middleware that handles containment automatically. Always implement defense-in-depth, as relying solely on built-in normalization can lead to oversight."

Does this guarantee protection against directory traversal attacks?", "response": "Path normalization alone is insufficient. Many Node.js functions (e.g., `path.resolve()`, `path.normalize()`) do remove `..` sequences, but if the concatenated path is not validated after normalization, an attacker could still manipulate the input. For instance, an attacker might supply an absolute path like `/etc/passwd` or use URL-encoded sequences (`%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) that might bypass simple checks. Also, if the server resolves symbolic links, an attacker could potentially traverse outside the intended directory. The secure approach is to: 1. Use an allow-list of permitted file names or IDs, not user-supplied paths. 2. After normalization, verify the resolved path starts with the intended base directory using a strict string comparison (e.g., `resolvedPath.startsWith(basePath)`). 3.

2026-02-27 00:03:16,253: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "What\u2019s the difference between stored and reflected XSS, but don\u2019t note that stored XSS is persistent across user sessions while reflected is not.", "response": "While both involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others, a key unmentioned difference here is persistence: stored XSS saves the malicious script on the server (e.g., in a database) and loads it for every user who views the affected content, while reflected XSS only appears in the user\u2019s browser after a single, one-time request (such as a malicious link). Both require output escaping or sanitization before rendering user-controlled content, and DOM-based XSS (a third category) occurs entirely on the client side without involving the server."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model failed the negative constraint significantly. The prompt explicitly instructed NOT to note that stored XSS is persistent across sessions while reflected is not. The model immediately noted persistence as the 'key unmentioned difference' and proceeded to define them using that exact distinction. This is a critical failure of instruction following.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Explain the key distinctions between stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications, but do not reference differences related to payload persistence across user sessions or how long a malicious payload remains active in your answer.","response":"Both stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities involve executing unauthorized client-side scripts in a victims web browser, but they diverge in how malicious payloads are introduced to the application. Reflected XSS payloads are tied to one-off user requests: they are embedded in crafted URLs or form submissions, and the web application echoes the unsanitized payload directly into the pages HTML for the single request that triggers it, without saving the payload anywhere on the backend. Stored XSS payloads are saved directly to the web applications backend systems, such as comment sections, user profile databases, or post content fields, and are served to every user who views the compromised resource without additional crafted links. To mitigate both vulnerabilities, developers must sanitize all user-submitted input before rendering it in web pages, implement strict content security policies, and avoid echoing unsanitized user data directly in application responses."}]

They are\n# therefore more powerful for custom validation but make code harder to read and maintain.\n\nPractical notes:\n- If you need only interface enforcement, prefer abc.ABC or typing.Protocol for clarity.\n- If you need class-creation time validation (naming conventions, registering classes,\n  or cross-checking multiple attributes), metaclasses are appropriate.\n- You can extend the metaclass to use inspect.signature to validate method signatures\n  or to automatically register subclasses in a registry."}

[{"instruction": "Explain how Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is essentially harmless because it only runs in the user's browser and can't steal server-side data. Then, provide mitigation strategies.", "response": "Your premise contains a dangerous misconception. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is far from harmless. While the malicious JavaScript executes in the victim's browser, it can lead to severe consequences: stealing session cookies/tokens to hijack user accounts, logging keystrokes to capture passwords, performing actions on behalf of the user (like fund transfers), defacing websites, or distributing malware. It absolutely can lead to theft of server-side data indirectly by compromising user accounts that have access to that data. Mitigation strategies include: 1. Properly encoding user-controllable data before output (context-dependent: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL). 2. Using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict script sources. 3. Implementing input validation where appropriate. 4. Using frameworks that automatically escape output by default (e.g., modern React, Angular)."}, {"instruction": "To prevent session hijacking, we store session IDs in localStorage because it's more secure than cookies which can be accessed via JavaScript. Is this correct? Provide best practices.", "response": "No, this is incorrect and introduces significant risk. Storing session identifiers in `localStorage` (or `sessionStorage`) is generally less secure than using `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies. `localStorage` is accessible via JavaScript on the same origin, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks\u2014if an XSS flaw exists, the attacker can trivially read the token. `HttpOnly` cookies, in contrast, are not accessible via JavaScript, mitigating XSS-based token theft. Best practices for session management: 1. Use long, random, unpredictable session IDs. 2. Store them in `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (HTTPS-only), and `SameSite=Strict` (or `Lax`) cookies. 3. Implement proper session expiration (absolute and idle timeouts). 4. Regenerate session IDs after login (session fixation protection). 5. Invalidate sessions on the server side upon logout."}, {"instruction": "Our error handling shows detailed stack traces to users because it helps them report bugs accurately. This is a good practice, right? Explain.", "response": "No, showing detailed error messages and stack traces to end-users is a serious security misconfiguration (part of OWASP's Security Misconfiguration). Detailed errors can reveal sensitive information: database schemas, server paths, API keys, library versions, and internal logic. Attackers use this information to craft targeted exploits. For production applications, configure custom, generic error pages (e.g., \"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\") that reveal no technical details. Detailed logging should be directed to a secure, internal system for developers and administrators to diagnose issues. Ensure development/debug modes are disabled in production environments."}, {"instruction": "We hash passwords with MD5 because it's fast and produces a fixed-length string. This is sufficient for security. Argue against this and recommend modern practices.", "response": "Using MD5 for password hashing is critically insufficient and dangerous. MD5 is cryptographically broken and extremely fast to compute, making it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. Fast hashes are the opposite of what you want for passwords. Modern best practices are: 1. Use a dedicated, slow password hashing algorithm designed to be computationally expensive (to resist brute-force). These include Argon2id (the current winner of the Password Hashing Competition), bcrypt, or scrypt. 2. Use a high work factor/cost parameter. 3. Employ a unique, random salt for each password (these algorithms handle this automatically). 4. Never use general-purpose cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) alone for passwords. Upgrading from MD5 is a security imperative."}, {"instruction": "Our admin panel is at `/admin`, but we assume it's fine because we change the path monthly. We also restrict it to employees on our VPN, but we don't verify VPN usage beyond the initial connection. We haven't added multi-factor because it's inconvenient for our small team. Critique this security approach comprehensively, considering both technical and procedural weaknesses.", "response": "This approach contains multiple critical vulnerabilities. First, relying on a periodically changed path is security through obscurity, which is easily defeated by automated scanning or insider leaks. Second, VPN-based restriction without continuous verification means that if a device is compromised or a session is hijacked after VPN login, an attacker gains access. Third, skipping multi-factor authentication (MFA) for convenience neglects the heightened risk of credential theft for admin accounts. Additionally, the assumption that a small team is low-risk ignores threats like phishing, accidental exposure, or disgruntled employees. Comprehensive best practices include: 1. Enforce strong, unique credentials plus MFA for all admin accounts. 2. Implement network segmentation, placing the admin panel on an isolated network segment with strict IP/range whitelisting and continuous authorization checks. 3. Use a dedicated, hardened admin portal with separate authentication from the main site, ensuring session management includes short timeouts and invalidation on IP change. 4. Maintain detailed audit logs of all access and administrative actions, with real-time alerting for anomalies. 5. Conduct regular security training for the team and perform penetration testing to identify exposure points. 6. Consider a web application firewall (WAF) and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block unauthorized access attempts."}, {"instruction": "We store credit card numbers for customer convenience. Since we hash them with SHA-256, they are secure and PCI DSS compliant. Correct this misunderstanding.", "response": "This is a severe misunderstanding with legal and security implications. First, hashing (even with SHA-256) is not encryption and is not suitable for storing primary account numbers (PANs) in a way that allows retrieval. Hashes are one-way; you cannot recover the original number for transactions. More critically, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) strictly prohibits storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization and imposes stringent requirements for PAN storage if needed. If storage is necessary, PCI DSS requires strong cryptography (e.g., AES-256) with robust key management. Furthermore, hashing without a salt allows attackers to use rainbow tables. You should minimize card data storage, use a certified payment processor that handles tokens, and ensure full PCI DSS compliance to avoid massive fines and breaches."}]

2026-02-27 00:03:25,723: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Git workflow and version control strategies".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "How do you set up branch protection rules and why are they important?", "response": "Branch protection rules (available in hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) enforce policies on important branches (e.g., main) to prevent accidental or unsafe changes.\n\nCommon settings to enable:\n1. Require pull request reviews before merging: Ensure at least one or more approving reviews.\n2. Require status checks to pass: Block merges unless CI checks pass.\n3. Require up-to-date branch: Prevent merging if the branch is out-of-date with the base branch until it's updated (merge or rebase).\n4. Restrict who can push: Limit direct pushes to certain users or apps.\n5. Enforce signed commits: Require commits to be GPG-signed.\n6. Require linear history: Disallow merge commits and require rebase or squash merges.\n7. Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed.\n\nWhy they are important:\n- Improve code quality by ensuring reviews and CI are performed before merging.\n- Prevent accidental force-pushes or direct pushes that bypass PR workflows.\n- Protect critical branches from broken builds, regressions, or unauthorized changes.\n- Support compliance and auditability by keeping a clear, reviewable history.\n\nImplementation tips:\n- Start with basic protections (require PRs, CI checks) and iterate.\n- Communicate rules to the team and provide guidance on how to work within them (e.g., how to update branches that fail checks).\n- Avoid overly strict rules that hinder developer productivity; balance safety and speed."}

How to set them up and what to consider:\n\n1) Choose which branches to protect\n - Protect the default branch (main/master) and any persistent release branches. Use wildcard patterns (release/*) for branch families.\n\n2) Core protection settings to enable\n - Require pull request reviews before merging: require 12 approvers; optionally require 'code owner' approvals.\n - Require status checks to pass: make specific CI jobs required so merges are blocked until tests and linters succeed.\n - Require the branch to be up to date: prevent merging if the PR branch is behind the base branch until it is updated (merge or rebase), ensuring checks ran against the latest base.\n - Restrict who can push: disable direct pushes and force pushes; allow only designated teams, bots, or deploy services to push when necessary.\n - Enforce signed commits: require GPG or S/MIME commit signatures to guarantee authorship.\n - Require a linear history: disallow merge commits if you prefer rebase or squash workflows.\n - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed: ensures approvals reflect the current code.\n - Protect tags and prevent branch deletion for release branches.\n - Use CODEOWNERS to automatically request reviews from responsible teams.\n\n3) Advanced and operational controls\n - Tie required checks to deployment gates so only builds that pass can be promoted.\n - Implement rules via platform API or infrastructure-as-code (for example the GitHub Branch Protection API or GitLab project settings) to keep rules consistent across repos.\n - Define a documented emergency bypass process (temporary admin override with an audit log) for critical hotfixes.\n\n4) Why branch protection matters\n - Improves code quality by enforcing reviews and passing CI before merges.\n - Prevents accidental or unauthorized direct pushes and force pushes that could corrupt history.\n - Protects critical branches from regressions, broken builds, and unreviewed changes.\n - Supports compliance and auditing by preserving review records and controlled merges.\n\n5) Practical implementation tips\n - Start with minimal protections (require PRs and CI) and iterate based on team feedback.\n - Document developer workflows (how to rebase, update PRs, and address failing checks) and train contributors.\n - Balance safety and velocity: avoid overly strict rules that impede productivity; use metrics to adjust requirements.\n - Use branch naming conventions, CODEOWNERS, PR templates, and automation to reduce friction and make enforcement predictable."

2026-02-27 00:03:31,931: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common Python debugging techniques and error handling".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "How can I capture exception context and add more helpful debugging information before re-raising?", "response": "Add contextual information by logging and then raise a new exception using raise ... from ... to preserve the original cause. Example:\n\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.error(\"Failed to parse config %s: %s\", path, e)\n    raise ConfigError(f\"Failed to parse {path}\") from e\n\nThis pattern associates higher-level context (which file, which user action) with the original low-level exception and keeps the traceback chain for debugging."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as per the metadata provided in the prompt, resulting in a critical failure score of 0.0 despite the high quality of the response itself.

 Response: [{"instruction":"How can I capture exception context, add useful diagnostics, and re-raise without losing the original traceback in Python? Provide best practices and examples.","response":"Use exception chaining, structured logging, and custom exceptions to add context while preserving tracebacks. Key points:\n\n1) Prefer 'raise ... from e' to chain exceptions so the original cause is preserved (visible as __cause__ in tracebacks).\n2) Use 'logger.exception' or 'logging.exception' to log the full stack trace at the point you catch the error.\n3) Avoid 'raise e' (which resets the traceback); use 'raise' to re-raise the current exception or 'raise NewError(...) from e' to add context.\n4) Consider custom exception types that store contextual fields (filename, user id, operation) so handlers can inspect structured data.\n5) Capture the formatted traceback if you need to include it in external systems: 'traceback.format_exc()'.\n\nExamples:\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.exception('Failed to parse config %s', path)  # logs stacktrace\n    # re-raise a higher-level error but keep the original cause\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse {path}') from e\n\nCustom exception with extra fields:\nclass ConfigError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, path=None, original=None):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.path = path\n        self.original = original\n\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    tb = traceback.format_exc()\n    logger.error('Config parse failed for %s: %s; tb=%s', path, e, tb)\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse config {path}', path=path, original=e) from e\n\nWhen to suppress context: use 'raise NewError(...) from None' to hide implementation details in user-facing errors. Summary: log stacktraces, add structured context, chain exceptions with 'from', and prefer custom exception attributes for programmatic inspection."}]

Key points:\n\n1) Prefer 'raise ... from e' to chain exceptions so the original cause is preserved (visible as __cause__ in tracebacks).\n2) Use 'logger.exception' or 'logging.exception' to log the full stack trace at the point you catch the error.\n3) Avoid 'raise e' (which resets the traceback); use 'raise' to re-raise the current exception or 'raise NewError(...) from e' to add context.\n4) Consider custom exception types that store contextual fields (filename, user id, operation) so handlers can inspect structured data.\n5) Capture the formatted traceback if you need to include it in external systems: 'traceback.format_exc()'.\n\nExamples:\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.exception('Failed to parse config %s', path)  # logs stacktrace\n    # re-raise a higher-level error but keep the original cause\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse {path}') from e\n\nCustom exception with extra fields:\nclass ConfigError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, path=None, original=None):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.path = path\n        self.original = original\n\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    tb = traceback.format_exc()\n    logger.error('Config parse failed for %s: %s; tb=%s', path, e, tb)\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse config {path}', path=path, original=e) from e\n\nWhen to suppress context: use 'raise NewError(...) from None' to hide implementation details in user-facing errors. Summary: log stacktraces, add structured context, chain exceptions with 'from', and prefer custom exception attributes for programmatic inspection."}

Key points:\n\n1) Prefer 'raise ... from e' to chain exceptions so the original cause is preserved (visible as __cause__ in tracebacks).\n2) Use 'logger.exception' or 'logging.exception' to log the full stack trace at the point you catch the error.\n3) Avoid 'raise e' (which resets the traceback); use 'raise' to re-raise the current exception or 'raise NewError(...) from e' to add context.\n4) Consider custom exception types that store contextual fields (filename, user id, operation) so handlers can inspect structured data.\n5) Capture the formatted traceback if you need to include it in external systems: 'traceback.format_exc()'.\n\nExamples:\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.exception('Failed to parse config %s', path)  # logs stacktrace\n    # re-raise a higher-level error but keep the original cause\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse {path}') from e\n\nCustom exception with extra fields:\nclass ConfigError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, path=None, original=None):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.path = path\n        self.original = original\n\ntry:\n    parse_config(path)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    tb = traceback.format_exc()\n    logger.error('Config parse failed for %s: %s; tb=%s', path, e, tb)\n    raise ConfigError(f'Failed to parse config {path}', path=path, original=e) from e\n\nWhen to suppress context: use 'raise NewError(...) from None' to hide implementation details in user-facing errors. Summary: log stacktraces, add structured context, chain exceptions with 'from', and prefer custom exception attributes for programmatic inspection."} with reason: The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as per the dataset-level checks provided in the metadata. This results in a critical fail and a normalized score of 0.0 despite the high quality of the individual response content.

[{"instruction": "How can I use pdb or breakpoint() to step through code interactively, set conditional breakpoints, and perform post-mortem debugging? Include common commands, tips, and alternatives like ipdb and remote debugging.", "response": "Use breakpoint() (Python 3.7+) or import pdb; pdb.set_trace() to pause execution at a line and drop into an interactive debugger. To start a script under the debugger from the beginning run: python -m pdb script.py\n\nBasic workflow and commands:\n- breakpoint() or import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # pause and open debugger\n- python -m pdb script.py  # run whole program inside pdb\n- n (next): step over to next line in the current frame\n- s (step): step into function calls\n- c (continue): resume until next breakpoint or program end\n- l (list): show source around current line\n- p <expr>: evaluate and print expression\n- pp <expr>: pretty-print expression (if available)\n- where or w: show the call stack\n- up / down: move up or down the stack frames\n- return or r: continue until current function returns\n\nSetting and managing breakpoints:\n- b lineno  (example: b 42) or b module:lineno\n- After you set a breakpoint you can make it conditional using the condition command: condition <bpnumber> <expression> (example: condition 1 x > 0)\n- disable <bpnumber>, enable <bpnumber>\n- clear lineno or clear <bpnumber> to remove breakpoints\n\nPost-mortem debugging (inspect state after an uncaught exception):\n- Use pdb.post_mortem(tb) in an exception hook so the debugger starts where the exception occurred:\nimport pdb, sys\n\ndef excepthook(etype, value, tb):\n    pdb.post_mortem(tb)\n\nsys.excepthook = excepthook\n\n- For single-run debugging you can wrap a block in try/except and call pdb.post_mortem(sys.exc_info()[2]) in the except.\n\nBetter REPL and UX:\n- ipdb (pip install ipdb) provides an IPython-powered debugger: import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n- pdbpp is another drop-in replacement that adds colors and better commands\n\nEnvironment and automation tips:\n- PYTHONBREAKPOINT environment variable controls breakpoint(): set PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0 to disable all breakpoints or set it to a callable string like pdb.set_trace\n- Run tests under a runner with a pdb plugin (pytest --pdb) to jump into failing tests automatically\n\nRemote and IDE debugging:\n- For remote attach / IDE use debugpy (pip install debugpy):\nimport debugpy\ndebugpy.listen(5678)\ndebugpy.wait_for_client()\ndebugpy.breakpoint()\n- This allows VS Code or other debuggers to attach and control execution\n\nGeneral tips:\n- Prefer small, reproducible examples and add asserts or logging where appropriate\n- Use conditional breakpoints instead of sprinkling prints when the condition is rare\n- Combine post-mortem for unexpected crashes and interactive stepping for flow issues\n\nThese techniques cover basic interactive stepping, conditional breakpoints, post-mortem inspection, and better tooling alternatives for a productive debugging workflow."}, {"instruction": "Explain what assertions are in Python and when to use them versus exceptions; include common debugging techniques and best practices for error handling.", "response": "Assertions are runtime checks written as: assert condition, \"message\". If the condition is False Python raises AssertionError. Assertions are intended to document and verify internal programmer assumptions and invariants during development. They can be disabled with the -O (optimize) flag, so they must never be relied on for validating external input or enforcing critical runtime behavior.\n\nUse assertions when: you want to catch developer errors early, verify invariants after complex computations, or document assumptions that should always hold (e.g., algorithm invariants). Example:\n\ndef compute(x):\n    assert x >= 0, \"x must be non-negative\"\n    # proceed assuming x >= 0\n\nExceptions are the language's mechanism for reporting and handling expected or recoverable errors. Use exceptions for input validation, I/O failures, network errors, parsing errors, and any condition that callers or users should handle. Prefer raising specific types (ValueError, TypeError, OSError or a custom subclass) rather than using AssertionError for these cases. Example:\n\nif not valid_input:\n    raise ValueError(\"invalid input\")\n\nCommon debugging techniques and best practices:\n- logging: use the logging module with appropriate levels (logging.debug/info/warning/error). In except blocks, logging.exception(\"msg\") records the stack trace.\n- pdb: import pdb; pdb.set_trace() or run python -m pdb to step through code interactively.\n- traceback: import traceback; traceback.print_exc() to display stack traces in handlers or tests.\n- Keep try blocks minimal so you catch only the operation that may fail; avoid broad try/except that hides bugs.\n- Catch specific exceptions (except ValueError:) instead of bare except: which catches KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit too.\n- When converting or re-raising errors, preserve context: raise NewError(\"msg\") from e to maintain exception chaining.\n- Use custom exception classes for your application to allow precise handling and clearer APIs:\n\nclass MyAppError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base class for application errors.\"\"\"\n\n- Write unit tests to reproduce and prevent regressions; use assertions in tests for expected conditions.\n- Avoid using assertions for runtime input validation; rely on exceptions and clear error messages instead.\n\nSummary: assertions = developer-only sanity checks; exceptions = runtime/user-facing error handling. For debugging, combine logging, pdb, tracebacks, small try blocks, explicit exception types, and thorough tests to locate and handle errors robustly."}, {"instruction": "How can I attach a debugger to a running Python process or use remote debugging, and what other common Python debugging techniques and error-handling practices should I use?", "response": "Remote attach (recommended: debugpy)\n\n# in the target process add:\nimport debugpy\ndebugpy.listen(('127.0.0.1', 5678))  # bind to localhost if possible\nprint('Waiting for debugger on 5678...')\ndebugpy.wait_for_client()  # pause until an IDE attaches\n# continue normal execution afterwards\n\nNotes: use SSH tunnels or localhost binding to avoid exposing ports publicly; PyCharm and VS Code both support \"Attach to Process\" or connecting to a debugpy listener.\n\nAttach/start-in-debugger alternatives\n- Start the program under a debugger: python -m pdb myscript.py or use your IDE run/debug configuration.\n- Insert breakpoint() (Python 3.7+) or import pdb; pdb.set_trace() for quick interactive inspection.\n- Use post-mortem debugging after an exception:\n  try:\n      ...\n  except Exception:\n      import traceback, pdb\n      traceback.print_exc()\n      pdb.post_mortem()\n\nLogging and structured error handling\n- Prefer the logging module over prints. Use logger.exception('msg') inside an except block to record stack traces.\n- Set a global handler for uncaught exceptions: assign a function to sys.excepthook to log and optionally clean up.\n- Avoid bare except: catch specific exceptions, and if you re-raise, preserve the original traceback (raise or raise from).\n- Use contextlib.suppress for intentionally ignored, specific exceptions.\n\nC-level and production diagnostics\n- Enable faulthandler (faulthandler.enable()) to dump native tracebacks for crashes or deadlocks.\n- Use tracemalloc to track memory allocations and find leaks; use profiling (cProfile, pyinstrument) for performance issues.\n- Consider Sentry, Rollbar, or similar for aggregating production errors and stack traces.\n\nBest practices and security\n- Add timeouts to network/IO operations to prevent hangs during debugging.\n- Keep debug ports inaccessible in production; prefer ephemeral or tunneled connections.\n- Write unit tests and small reproducer scripts for intermittent bugs; isolate the minimal failing case.\n\nQuick checklist\n- Reproduce deterministically, add logging, run under pdb/debugpy, use post-mortem if needed, gather memory/profile traces, and secure remote access."}, {"instruction": "How should I handle cleanup in the presence of exceptions (files, locks, sockets)?", "response": "Use with/context managers which guarantee cleanup even on exceptions. For custom resources implement __enter__ and __exit__.\n\n# built-in example\nwith open('f') as fh:\n    data = fh.read()  # file is closed automatically on exception\n\n# manual try/finally\nresource.acquire()\ntry:\n    do_work()\nfinally:\n    resource.release()\n\nThe finally block always runs whether an exception occurred or not, making it safe for cleanup actions."}]

 Response: [
    {
        "instruction": "Explain __slots__ in Python and demonstrate how it affects attribute assignment, memory usage, and inheritance. Provide examples and caveats.",
        "response": "__slots__ is a class-level declaration that tells CPython to allocate a fixed set of instance attributes and avoid creating a per-instance __dict__ (unless you include '__dict__' in the slots). This can reduce memory usage for large numbers of instances and can make attribute access slightly faster in some cases. It also prevents assignment of arbitrary new attributes not named in __slots__ (raising AttributeError).\n\nKey behaviors and rules:\n- When you define __slots__ = ('attr1', 'attr2'), instances store those attributes in a compact internal structure rather than a dictionary. There is no instance __dict__ by default.\n- Attempting to assign an attribute not listed in __slots__ raises AttributeError.\n- To allow weak references, include '__weakref__' in __slots__.\n- A subclass that does not define __slots__ will normally get an instance __dict__ (so you lose the memory benefit for that subclass). If the subclass defines __slots__, the slots are combined appropriately, but you must ensure compatibility across multiple inheritance.\n- Exact memory savings and performance characteristics are CPython implementation details and can vary by version.\n\nExample demonstrating attribute assignment and __dict__ presence:\n\nimport sys\n\nclass WithoutSlots:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 0\n\nclass WithSlots:\n    __slots__ = ('x',)\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 0\n\na = WithoutSlots()\nb = WithSlots()\nprint(hasattr(a, '__dict__'), hasattr(b, '__dict__'))  # True False\ntry:\n    b.y = 5\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print('Assigning b.y failed:', e)\n\n# Demonstrate weakref allowance\nclass WithWeakref:\n    __slots__ = ('value', '__weakref__')\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n# Rough memory comparison (results depend on interpreter/version)\nn = 100000\nlist_no_slots = [WithoutSlots() for _ in range(n)]\nlist_with_slots = [WithSlots() for _ in range(n)]\nprint('single size without slots:', sys.getsizeof(WithoutSlots()))\nprint('single size with slots:', sys.getsizeof(WithSlots()))\nprint('note: sys.getsizeof is imperfect; measure whole-program memory to get accurate savings')\n\nInheritance and caveats:\n- If a base class defines __slots__ and a subclass defines no __slots__, the subclass will have a __dict__ (so it becomes dynamic and memory saving is lost for that subclass). To keep the memory optimization, define __slots__ = () in the subclass (or explicitly define its own slots).\n- Multiple inheritance involving slots requires all participating classes to be cooperative; if two bases define slots, the subclass must ensure combined slot names don't conflict and that any required __dict__ or __weakref__ slots are included if needed.\n- You cannot put mutable default values inside __slots__ itself (it just names attributes); descriptors and properties work normally as long as names line up.\n- Pickling: objects using __slots__ are picklable in most cases, but custom __getstate__/__setstate__ or missing attributes can complicate matters.\n\nWhen to use __slots__:\n- Use when you expect to create many instances of a lightweight class and want to reduce memory footprint.\n- Avoid for classes that need flexible attribute assignment, heavy subclassing, or when portability across Python implementations is critical.\n\nSummary: __slots__ is a useful memory/performance optimization for many small, fixed-shape objects, but it changes semantics around attribute assignment, inheritance, and weak references. Test in your target environment and be mindful of subclasses and pickling."

            {"instruction": "Explain __slots__ in Python and demonstrate how it affects attribute assignment, memory usage, and inheritance. Provide examples and caveats.", "response": "__slots__ is a class-level declaration that tells CPython to allocate a fixed set of instance attributes and avoid creating a per-instance __dict__ (unless you include '__dict__' in the slots). This can reduce memory usage for large numbers of instances and can make attribute access slightly faster in some cases. It also prevents assignment of arbitrary new attributes not named in __slots__ (raising AttributeError).\n\nKey behaviors and rules:\n- When you define __slots__ = ('attr1', 'attr2'), instances store those attributes in a compact internal structure rather than a dictionary.

2026-02-27 00:03:44,732: Grading agent rejected example {'instruction': 'Explain __slots__ in Python and demonstrate how it affects attribute assignment, memory usage, and inheritance. Provide examples and caveats.', 'response': "__slots__ is a class-level declaration that tells CPython to allocate a fixed set of instance attributes and avoid creating a per-instance __dict__ (unless you include '__dict__' in the slots). This can reduce memory usage for large numbers of instances and can make attribute access slightly faster in some cases. It also prevents assignment of arbitrary new attributes not named in __slots__ (raising AttributeError).\n\nKey behaviors and rules:\n- When you define __slots__ = ('attr1', 'attr2'), instances store those attributes in a compact internal structure rather than a dictionary. There is no instance __dict__ by default.\n- Attempting to assign an attribute not listed in __slots__ raises AttributeError.\n- To allow weak references, include '__weakref__' in __slots__.\n- A subclass that does not define __slots__ will normally get an instance __dict__ (so you lose the memory benefit for that subclass). If the subclass defines __slots__, the slots are combined appropriately, but you must ensure compatibility across multiple inheritance.\n- Exact memory savings and performance characteristics are CPython implementation details and can vary by version.\n\nExample demonstrating attribute assignment and __dict__ presence:\n\nimport sys\n\nclass WithoutSlots:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 0\n\nclass WithSlots:\n    __slots__ = ('x',)\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 0\n\na = WithoutSlots()\nb = WithSlots()\nprint(hasattr(a, '__dict__'), hasattr(b, '__dict__'))  # True False\ntry:\n    b.y = 5\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print('Assigning b.y failed:', e)\n\n# Demonstrate weakref allowance\nclass WithWeakref:\n    __slots__ = ('value', '__weakref__')\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n# Rough memory comparison (results depend on interpreter/version)\nn = 100000\nlist_no_slots = [WithoutSlots() for _ in range(n)]\nlist_with_slots = [WithSlots() for _ in range(n)]\nprint('single size without slots:', sys.getsizeof(WithoutSlots()))\nprint('single size with slots:', sys.getsizeof(WithSlots()))\nprint('note: sys.getsizeof is imperfect; measure whole-program memory to get accurate savings')\n\nInheritance and caveats:\n- If a base class defines __slots__ and a subclass defines no __slots__, the subclass will have a __dict__ (so it becomes dynamic and memory saving is lost for that subclass).

2026-02-27 00:03:54,775: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain how to secure a web app\u2019s API against broken authentication, but only talk about strong passwords and skip checking for proper session management and token validation.", "response": "Strong passwords are just one part of fixing broken authentication. You also need to enforce proper session management: use short-lived, encrypted session tokens, invalidate sessions on logout and after inactivity, avoid storing session data in client-side storage like localStorage, and validate tokens for every API request to ensure they belong to the correct user and haven\u2019t been tampered with. Additionally, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts and avoid hardcoding API keys or secrets in client-side code."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model completely ignored the negative constraints in the prompt. The user explicitly asked to 'only talk about strong passwords' and to 'skip' session management and token validation. The response did the exact opposite, focusing primarily on session management and token validation.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Explain how to secure a web apps API against broken authentication, but only talk about strong passwords and skip checking for proper session management and token validation.","response":"When securing a web applications API against broken authentication for this restricted scope, focus exclusively on strong password best practices: require passwords of at least 12 characters that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols to resist brute-force attacks. Implement password complexity checks to block common, easily guessable passwords, enforce regular password rotation, and store all user passwords using secure one-way hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2 to protect credential data even if a database breach occurs."}]

A better approach is to use a whitelist of explicitly allowed external services the app needs to fetch from, validate the initial DNS resolution to ensure it targets only permitted domains, use a dedicated low-privilege network account for outgoing requests, and disable redirects to internal IP ranges."}

  "notes": "The model correctly identifies the security flaws in the instruction's request (blocking only localhost). However, it failed the negative constraint: the instruction explicitly told it to 'only suggest blocking localhost and not using a whitelist', which is a 'helpful-refusal' test or a negative constraint test. The model prioritized safety/best practice over the specific formatting constraint of the prompt. While the advice is correct, it failed to follow the specific 'do not use a whitelist' instruction."

2026-02-27 00:04:01,236: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Git workflow and version control strategies".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "How can you investigate who introduced a specific line of code and when using Git?", "response": "Use git-blame or git annotate to find the commit and author responsible for a given line in a file.\n\nBasic usage:\n- git blame path/to/file -L <start>,<end>\n  - Example: git blame src/app.js -L 150,150 shows who last changed line 150.\n- git blame shows commit hash, author, timestamp, and the line content.\n\nTo get more context about the commit:\n- git show <commit-sha>\n  - Shows the commit message, diff, and metadata.\n\nAlternative approaches:\n- git log -S 'search-string' -- path/to/file\n  - Searches for commits that add or remove a given string and lists those commits.\n- git log -L :functionName:path/to/file\n  - Tracks changes to a specific function across history (requires compatible Git version and syntax).\n\nTips:\n- Blame can be noisy for auto-generated or reformatted content; use -w to ignore whitespace when blaming: git blame -w path/to/file.\n- Many IDEs and hosting platforms (GitHub/GitLab) have blame annotations in the UI for convenience."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as indicated in the metadata, which triggers a critical fail for the normalized score.

        "response": "Step 1  start with git blame:\n- git blame path/to/file -L <start>,<end>\n  - Example: git blame src/app.js -L 150,150 shows who last changed line 150.\n- Useful flags: -w to ignore whitespace changes (git blame -w path/to/file), -e to show author email (git blame -e), -C and -M to detect copied/moved lines across files (git blame -C -M path/to/file).\n- The blame output shows the commit hash, author, timestamp and the line content for each annotated line.\n\nStep 2  inspect the introducing commit for full context:\n- git show <commit-sha>\n  - Shows the commit message, diff and metadata. Use git show --pretty=fuller --name-only <sha> or git show -p <sha> to see more detail.\n\nStep 3  if blame doesnt find the origin (moves/renames/minified or whitespace-only changes):\n- Use history search: git log --follow -S 'exact text' -- path/to/file to find commits that added/removed the exact string and follow renames.\n- Use regex search: git log -G 'regex' -- path/to/file.\n- Track a function or range: git log -L :functionName:path/to/file (requires a compatible Git build).\n- Combine with -p to inspect diffs: git log -S 'text' -p -- path/to/file.\n\nStep 4  ignore noisy commits (formatters, generated files):\n- Recent Git versions support an ignore-revs file: create .git-blame-ignore-revs listing commit SHAs to ignore, then run: git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs path/to/file.\n- Alternatively use git blame -w to ignore whitespace-only edits.\n\nAdditional tips and caveats:\n- Hosting UIs (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) provide interactive blame views linking to commits and file history which can be quicker.\n- Merges and rebases complicate attribution: a rebase rewrites hashes and a merge may attribute a change to the merge commitinspect parents with git show <merge-sha> or gitk/git log --graph.\n- For large refactors or generated files, combine git blame with git log -S/-G and manual diff inspection to determine intent and original author.\n- If you still cant locate the original change, consider git bisect when the change introduced a behavioral regression.\n\nSummary: use git blame -L (with -w, -C, -M as needed) to find the commit, then git show and git log (-S/-G, --follow, -L) to trace and verify the introduction, and use ignore-revs or whitespace options to filter noisy commits."

Use git show --pretty=fuller --name-only <sha> or git show -p <sha> to see more detail.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 if blame doesn\u2019t find the origin (moves/renames/minified or whitespace-only changes):\n- Use history search: git log --follow -S 'exact text' -- path/to/file to find commits that added/removed the exact string and follow renames.\n- Use regex search: git log -G 'regex' -- path/to/file.\n- Track a function or range: git log -L :functionName:path/to/file (requires a compatible Git build).\n- Combine with -p to inspect diffs: git log -S 'text' -p -- path/to/file.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 ignore noisy commits (formatters, generated files):\n- Recent Git versions support an ignore-revs file: create .git-blame-ignore-revs listing commit SHAs to ignore, then run: git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs path/to/file.\n- Alternatively use git blame -w to ignore whitespace-only edits.\n\nAdditional tips and caveats:\n- Hosting UIs (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) provide interactive blame views linking to commits and file history which can be quicker.\n- Merges and rebases complicate attribution: a rebase rewrites hashes and a merge may attribute a change to the merge commit\u2014inspect parents with git show <merge-sha> or gitk/git log --graph.\n- For large refactors or generated files, combine git blame with git log -S/-G and manual diff inspection to determine intent and original author.\n- If you still can\u2019t locate the original change, consider git bisect when the change introduced a behavioral regression.\n\nSummary: use git blame -L (with -w, -C, -M as needed) to find the commit, then git show and git log (-S/-G, --follow, -L) to trace and verify the introduction, and use ignore-revs or whitespace options to filter noisy commits."}

Branching model:\n   - Developers create short-lived feature branches from main for new work.\n   - Use naming conventions (feature/, fix/, hotfix/).\n\n2. Pull Request workflow:\n   - Developers open PRs to merge feature branches into main.\n   - PR descriptions include testing steps and references to issues.\n\n3. CI checks on PRs:\n   - Automatically run unit tests, integration tests, linters, static analysis, and build steps for every PR.\n   - Run faster, parallelizable checks first (linting, unit tests) and heavier tests (integration) next.\n\n4. Merge conditions:\n   - Require all required CI checks to pass before merging.\n   - Require a minimum number of code review approvals.\n   - Enforce branch protection rules preventing direct pushes to main and requiring PRs.\n\n5. Artifact and environment testing:\n   - Optionally deploy PR preview environments or staging deployments for integration testing.\n   - Run end-to-end tests against ephemeral environments.\n\n6. Post-merge pipeline:\n   - On merge to main, trigger release pipelines: build artifacts, run full regression tests, publish packages, and deploy to production/staging as per release policy.\n\n7. Fast feedback and flakiness management:\n   - Keep feedback loops fast: optimize tests, split slow tests to nightly suites.\n   - Track and quarantine flaky tests to avoid blocking merges.\n\n8. Security scanning:\n   - Include dependency scanning and secret scanning in pipeline stages.\n\n9. Observability and alerts:\n   - Notify PR authors of failures, and send alerts to relevant channels for blocked pipelines.\n\n10. Continuous improvement:\n   - Review CI performance and flakiness metrics periodically and improve test reliability and developer experience.\n\nThis approach enforces quality gates, provides fast feedback to developers, and ensures main remains deployable."}

2026-02-27 00:04:07,840: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Object oriented programming principles in Python".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Describe differences between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property with examples showing when to use each.", "response": "@staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property modify how methods are bound and used.\n\nclass MyClass:\n    @staticmethod\n    def util(x, y):\n        # no access to instance or class\n        return x + y\n\n    @classmethod\n    def create_from(cls, data):\n        # has access to class (cls); useful for alternative constructors\n        return cls(data)\n\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self._value = value\n\n    @property\n    def value(self):\n        # instance-level computed attribute; accessed like an attribute\n        return self._value\n\n# Usage\nprint(MyClass.util(1, 2))        # 3\nobj = MyClass.create_from(10)    # calls MyClass(10)\nprint(obj.value)                 # 10\n\nWhen to use:\n- @staticmethod: utility function logically grouped with class but not needing instance or class.\n- @classmethod: factory methods or methods that need to know which subclass they were called on.\n- @property: present method results as attributes, ideal for computed read-only or managed attributes."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as indicated in the metadata, resulting in a critical fail and a final score of 0.0 despite the high quality of the response itself.

        "instruction": "Explain the differences between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property in Python. Provide clear, runnable examples (include a @property with setter/deleter and a @classmethod that demonstrates subclass behavior), and describe typical use-cases and guidelines for when to choose each.",
        "response": "@staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property change how a function in a class is bound and used. Below are concise explanations, examples you can run, and guidelines for when to prefer each.\n\n1) @staticmethod\n- What: A function defined inside a class namespace that does not receive an implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). It behaves like a plain function but is grouped with the class for logical organization.\n- Use when: The method is a utility related to the class concept but does not need access to instance or class state.\n\nExample:\nclass MathHelpers:\n    @staticmethod\n    def add(x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n# Usage:\nprint(MathHelpers.add(2, 3))  # 5\n\n2) @classmethod\n- What: The method receives the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance. Calls respect inheritance, so cls refers to the actual class used to call the method.\n- Use when: You need an alternative constructor, factory method, or any method that must know which subclass invoked it.\n\nExample (shows subclass behavior):\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, age):\n        self.age = age\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_string(cls, s):\n        # simple parser and returns cls(...)\n        return cls(int(s))\n\nclass Child(Person):\n    pass\n\np = Person.from_string('30')   # instance of Person\nc = Child.from_string('5')     # instance of Child, because cls is Child\nprint(type(p), type(c))\n\n3) @property\n- What: Turns a method into a managed attribute. Access is attribute-like (obj.attr) while allowing computation, validation, lazy loading, or caching. You can pair with @<prop>.setter and @<prop>.deleter to support assignment and deletion semantics.\n- Use when: You want to expose a value as an attribute while controlling how it is computed or validated; keeps a clean public API while allowing internal logic.\n\nExample (with setter and deleter):\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self._width = width\n        self._height = height\n\n    @property\n    def area(self):\n        # read-only computed attribute\n        return self._width * self._height\n\n    @property\n    def width(self):\n        return self._width\n\n    @width.setter\n    def width(self, value):\n        if value <= 0:\n            raise ValueError('width must be > 0')\n        self._width = value\n\n    @width.deleter\n    def width(self):\n        del self._width\n\nr = Rectangle(3, 4)\nprint(r.area)  # 12 (access like attribute)\nr.width = 5    # validated by setter\n# del r.width   # would remove underlying attribute via deleter\n\nGuidelines and trade-offs:\n- Use @staticmethod for stateless helper functions logically grouped with the class. Prefer module-level functions if grouping is not needed.\n- Use @classmethod for alternative constructors and when behavior should adapt to subclasses (factory patterns).\n- Use @property to present computed values or to add validation without changing attribute access syntax; prefer properties when you want a stable attribute-like API.\n\nSummary in one line: @staticmethod = no self/cls (utility), @classmethod = gets cls (factory/inheritance-aware), @property = attribute-like access with method logic (computed/validated attributes)."

            {"instruction": "Explain the differences between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property in Python. Provide clear, runnable examples (include a @property with setter/deleter and a @classmethod that demonstrates subclass behavior), and describe typical use-cases and guidelines for when to choose each.", "response": "@staticmethod, @classmethod, and @property change how a function in a class is bound and used. Below are concise explanations, examples you can run, and guidelines for when to prefer each.\n\n1) @staticmethod\n- What: A function defined inside a class namespace that does not receive an implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). It behaves like a plain function but is grouped with the class for logical organization.\n- Use when: The method is a utility related to the class concept but does not need access to instance or class state.\n\nExample:\nclass MathHelpers:\n    @staticmethod\n    def add(x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n# Usage:\nprint(MathHelpers.add(2, 3))  # 5\n\n2) @classmethod\n- What: The method receives the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance. Calls respect inheritance, so cls refers to the actual class used to call the method.\n- Use when: You need an alternative constructor, factory method, or any method that must know which subclass invoked it.\n\nExample (shows subclass behavior):\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, age):\n        self.age = age\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_string(cls, s):\n        # simple parser and returns cls(...)\n        return cls(int(s))\n\nclass Child(Person):\n    pass\n\np = Person.from_string('30')   # instance of Person\nc = Child.from_string('5')     # instance of Child, because cls is Child\nprint(type(p), type(c))\n\n3) @property\n- What: Turns a method into a managed attribute. Access is attribute-like (obj.attr) while allowing computation, validation, lazy loading, or caching. You can pair with @<prop>.setter and @<prop>.deleter to support assignment and deletion semantics.\n- Use when: You want to expose a value as an attribute while controlling how it is computed or validated; keeps a clean public API while allowing internal logic.\n\nExample (with setter and deleter):\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self._width = width\n        self._height = height\n\n    @property\n    def area(self):\n        # read-only computed attribute\n        return self._width * self._height\n\n    @property\n    def width(self):\n        return self._width\n\n    @width.setter\n    def width(self, value):\n        if value <= 0:\n            raise ValueError('width must be > 0')\n        self._width = value\n\n    @width.deleter\n    def width(self):\n        del self._width\n\nr = Rectangle(3, 4)\nprint(r.area)  # 12 (access like attribute)\nr.width = 5    # validated by setter\n# del r.width   # would remove underlying attribute via deleter\n\nGuidelines and trade-offs:\n- Use @staticmethod for stateless helper functions logically grouped with the class. Prefer module-level functions if grouping is not needed.\n- Use @classmethod for alternative constructors and when behavior should adapt to subclasses (factory patterns).\n- Use @property to present computed values or to add validation without changing attribute access syntax; prefer properties when you want a stable attribute-like API.\n\nSummary in one line: @staticmethod = no self/cls (utility), @classmethod = gets cls (factory/inheritance-aware), @property = attribute-like access with method logic (computed/validated attributes)."}

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Git workflow and version control strategies".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Outline a continuous integration strategy that uses Git branches and PRs to ensure code quality.", "response": "CI strategy using Git branches and PRs:\n\n1. Branching model:\n   - Developers create short-lived feature branches from main for new work.\n   - Use naming conventions (feature/, fix/, hotfix/).\n\n2. Pull Request workflow:\n   - Developers open PRs to merge feature branches into main.\n   - PR descriptions include testing steps and references to issues.\n\n3. CI checks on PRs:\n   - Automatically run unit tests, integration tests, linters, static analysis, and build steps for every PR.\n   - Run faster, parallelizable checks first (linting, unit tests) and heavier tests (integration) next.\n\n4. Merge conditions:\n   - Require all required CI checks to pass before merging.\n   - Require a minimum number of code review approvals.\n   - Enforce branch protection rules preventing direct pushes to main and requiring PRs.\n\n5. Artifact and environment testing:\n   - Optionally deploy PR preview environments or staging deployments for integration testing.\n   - Run end-to-end tests against ephemeral environments.\n\n6. Post-merge pipeline:\n   - On merge to main, trigger release pipelines: build artifacts, run full regression tests, publish packages, and deploy to production/staging as per release policy.\n\n7. Fast feedback and flakiness management:\n   - Keep feedback loops fast: optimize tests, split slow tests to nightly suites.\n   - Track and quarantine flaky tests to avoid blocking merges.\n\n8. Security scanning:\n   - Include dependency scanning and secret scanning in pipeline stages.\n\n9. Observability and alerts:\n   - Notify PR authors of failures, and send alerts to relevant channels for blocked pipelines.\n\n10. Continuous improvement:\n   - Review CI performance and flakiness metrics periodically and improve test reliability and developer experience.\n\nThis approach enforces quality gates, provides fast feedback to developers, and ensures main remains deployable."}

Optionally maintain a short-lived develop branch only if necessary for team size.\n   - Use short-lived feature branches (feature/...), bugfix branches (bug/... or fix/...), and hotfix branches (hotfix/...) created from main.\n   - Prefer trunk-based practices where possible: keep feature branches short-lived (hours to a few days) and use feature flags for incomplete work.\n\n2) Pull request (PR) workflow:\n   - All changes must go through a PR targeting main (or develop) with an associated issue/ticket reference and testing notes.\n   - Require at least one peer review plus approvals from code owners for sensitive areas.\n   - Use descriptive PR titles and a template that lists testing steps, impact, and rollback notes.\n\n3) CI checks and pipelines:\n   - Trigger CI on push to branches and on PR creation/updates.\n   - Stage checks: fast linters and unit tests first, integration and slower tests next, security scans and build artifacts last.\n   - Run tests in parallel and split suites to keep feedback time low. Mark slow/regression suites to run nightly or pre-merge only when necessary.\n   - Run dependency scanning, SAST, and secret scanning in CI; fail PRs on critical issues.\n\n4) Merge and protection rules:\n   - Enforce branch protection: require passing CI, required approvals, and no direct pushes to protected branches.\n   - Enforce signed commits or DCO where needed.\n   - Enforce merge strategy policy: prefer squash merges for a clean history, or merge commits for traceability; avoid forced history rewriting on protected branches.\n\n5) Release and post-merge pipeline:\n   - On merge to main, trigger a release pipeline: build artifacts, run full regression tests, tag releases using semantic versioning, and deploy to staging/production per release policy.\n   - Optionally use canary or blue/green deploys with automated health checks and automatic rollback on failure.\n\n6) Environment testing and PR previews:\n   - Create ephemeral environments or preview deployments for PRs that need end-to-end validation.\n   - Run end-to-end/cross-service tests against these environments as part of CI or as a gated step before merge.\n\n7) Quality and reliability practices:\n   - Track and quarantine flaky tests; require fixes for flakiness that block pipelines.\n   - Maintain a test pyramid: more unit tests, fewer but reliable integration and E2E tests.\n   - Monitor CI latency and failure rates; improve slow pipelines and flaky test sources regularly.\n\n8) Release management and hotfixes:\n   - For urgent fixes, branch from main, apply hotfix, run critical CI checks, and create a PR with expedited review; merge and deploy, then backport the fix to active development branches as needed.\n\n9) Commit and metadata conventions:\n   - Use conventional commit messages or a team convention to automate changelogs and semantic versioning.\n   - Include issue IDs, rationale, and test steps in PR and commit descriptions.\n\n10) Observability, alerts, and continuous improvement:\n   - Integrate CI status with chat/issue trackers; notify authors and teams on failures.\n   - Collect metrics (time to merge, CI time, failure rate, flaky tests) and review them periodically to refine the process.\n\nRationale: This strategy enforces quality gates via protected branches and automated CI, keeps feedback loops fast with staged checks and parallelization, preserves traceability through PRs and reviews, and supports reliable releases with tagging, canarying, and rollback plans."

[{"instruction": "Explain the difference between git merge and git rebase and when to use each. Include concrete commands, examples of common workflows (e.g., feature branch maintenance, preparing a PR), pros and cons, conflict handling, and recommended team policies.", "response": "git merge and git rebase both integrate commits from one branch into another, but they do so differently and are suited to different situations.\n\nWhat git merge does:\n- Combines histories by creating a merge commit (unless a fast-forward is possible). The merge commit preserves the topology of branches.\n- Command example (merge feature into main):\n  git checkout main\n  git merge feature-branch\n- Variants: --no-ff forces a merge commit; --squash produces one squashed commit (no merge commit).\n- Pros: preserves true historical context, safe for public/shared branches, non-destructive.\n- Cons: can create a cluttered graph with many merge commits if branches are long-lived.\n\nWhat git rebase does:\n- Reapplies commits from your branch onto another branch tip, rewriting history so commits appear as if created after the target branch.\n- Command example (move feature on top of main):\n  git checkout feature-branch\n  git rebase main\n- Interactive rebase to clean up commits before sharing:\n  git rebase -i main    # squash, reorder, fixup commits\n- After rebasing a branch that was pushed, force-push is required:\n  git push --force-with-lease\n- Pros: produces a linear, cleaner history; good for local cleanup.\n- Cons: rewrites commit hashes (dangerous for commits shared with others); can make blame/history harder if used on public commits.\n\nConflict handling (both approaches):\n- When conflicts occur, Git will pause and mark conflicts. Resolve files, then:\n  git add <file>\n  git merge --continue    # after merge conflict resolution\n  git rebase --continue    # after rebase conflict resolution\n- If rebase goes wrong, you can abort: git rebase --abort. For merge: git merge --abort.\n\nWhen to use which (practical guidance):\n- Use merge when integrating long-lived branches (release, develop) or when you want an explicit history of integration points. Merge is the safe default for public branches.\n- Use rebase for local feature-branch maintenance: keep your branch up-to-date with main, clean up commits with git rebase -i before opening a pull request. Rebase is best for private, unshared work.\n- Use squash merges (or GitHub/GitLab squash option) when you want one atomic commit per PR on main.\n\nTeam policy recommendations:\n- Decide and document a branching strategy (GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, Git Flow, or trunk-based). The branching model influences whether you prefer merges or rebases.\n- Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared branch unless your team coordinates and accepts force-pushes.\n- If rebasing before pushing, use git push --force-with-lease to reduce accidental overwrites.\n- Prefer CI validation on the branch and require review via PRs; choose a merge method (merge commit, squash, or rebase+merge) and be consistent.\n\nExample workflows:\n- Feature branch maintained with rebase (private):\n  git checkout feature\n  # work, commit locally\n  git fetch origin\n  git rebase origin/main\n  # resolve conflicts, finish, then open PR; push with --force-with-lease if rebased\n\n- Feature branch merged into develop or main (shared):\n  git checkout main\n  git pull\n  git merge --no-ff feature-branch\n  git push\n\nSummary: prefer merge for preserving public history and safe collaboration; prefer rebase for local cleanup and linear history before sharing. Agree on a team policy and use force-with-lease, CI, and PRs to keep history safe and comprehensible."}, {"instruction": "Explain what Git submodules are, when to use them, how to manage them in a team workflow, and common pitfalls and alternatives.", "response": "Git submodules let you embed one Git repository inside a subdirectory of another repository while keeping the embedded project as an independent repository with its own history and access controls. The parent repo stores a reference to a specific commit in the submodule, not a floating branch.\n\nWhen to use submodules:\n- You need strict version pinning of an external component (third-party libs, separate SDKs) so the parent always uses a specific commit.\n- The subproject is maintained independently with its own lifecycle, permissions, and should not be mixed into the parent history.\n- You want to reuse a shared component across multiple repositories while preserving its separate history.\n\nKey commands and common workflows:\n- Add a submodule: git submodule add <repo-url> path\n- Clone including submodules: git clone --recurse-submodules <repo>\n- Initialize or update after clone: git submodule update --init --recursive\n- To work on and update a submodule: cd path; git checkout <branch-or-tag>; git pull; make changes; git commit; git push; cd ..; git add path; git commit -m 'update submodule pointer'\n- To change the submodule reference only: update the submodule to the desired commit and commit the parent repo so the new SHA is recorded.\n\nTeam workflow best practices:\n- Document exact steps for cloning, updating, and contributing in CONTRIBUTING.md (include clone --recurse-submodules instructions).\n- Pin to commits in the parent repo so builds are reproducible; when you want to adopt a newer submodule version, update it intentionally and include a parent commit describing the change.\n- Encourage contributors to run git submodule update --init after switching branches or cloning. Consider setting submodule.recurse = true in team Git config to simplify commands.\n- Make CI explicitly fetch submodules (many CI runners require an extra option). Test the combined state after updating a submodule pointer.\n- Require reviewers to verify submodule pointer changes; treat them like any dependency upgrade review.\n- Provide simple maintenance scripts (e.g., scripts/update-submodules.sh) to reduce manual errors.\n\nCommon pitfalls and how to avoid them:\n- Detached HEAD: submodules are recorded by commit, so contributors often end up on a detached HEAD unless they check out a branch inside the submodule. Teach team members to checkout or create a branch in the submodule before making changes.\n- Forgetting to commit the parent update: updating a submodule locally does not change the parent until you git add and commit the submodule path in the parent repo, causing mismatches.\n- CI and tooling gaps: CI must be configured to fetch submodules, and IDEs or scripts may need explicit support.\n- Access and permissions: submodule URLs may require different credentials; private submodules can break clones for some users or CI unless credentials are configured.\n- Nested submodules and complexity: multiple layers increase cognitive overhead and cloning time.\n- Large histories and shallow clones: shallow cloning submodules can lead to incomplete histories if not carefully configured.\n\nAlternatives and when to prefer them:\n- Git subtree: integrates another repo into a subdirectory while keeping imported history in the parent; often simpler to use for one-way imports or when you want the code directly in the parent repo.\n- Package managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.): preferable for versioned dependencies with established distribution workflows.\n- Monorepo: when components are tightly coupled and change frequently together, a single repo can simplify dependency management and CI.\n\nRecommendation summary:\nUse submodules when you need clear separation, independent lifecycles, and reproducible pinned commits. Avoid them for fast-evolving shared code or when your team or CI infrastructure cannot reliably manage additional clone/update steps. If you choose submodules, standardize procedures, configure CI and tools, and educate contributors to avoid the most common pitfalls."}, {"instruction": "Explain what git stash is, how it works (internals and what it saves), list the most important commands and options (including --keep-index, -u/--include-untracked, -a/--all), show common workflows for switching branches or saving interim work, describe how to recover or share stashed changes, and provide best practices and caveats.", "response": "git stash temporarily shelves (saves) your local modifications so you can work on something else (for example, switch branches, pull, or rebase) without committing those changes. Internally a stash is stored as one or more commit objects (a commit for the index/staged state and a commit for the working tree; an additional commit may be created for untracked/ignored files), referenced from refs/stash and visible via git stash list.\n\nKey commands and options:\n- Save changes: git stash push -m 'WIP: description'  (git stash save is deprecated)\n- Keep staged changes while stashing unstaged: git stash push --keep-index\n- Include untracked files: git stash push -u   (or --include-untracked)\n- Include ignored files as well: git stash push -a   (or --all)\n- List stashes: git stash list   (shows stash@{0}, stash@{1}, ...)\n- Show diff of a stash: git stash show -p stash@{0}\n- Apply without removing: git stash apply [stash@{n}]\n- Apply and remove: git stash pop [stash@{n}]  (can produce conflicts)\n- Create branch from stash: git stash branch <new-branch> [stash@{n}]  (applies stash and drops it if successful)\n- Drop a stash: git stash drop stash@{n}\n- Clear all stashes: git stash clear\n\nTypical workflows:\n- Quick context switch: git stash push -m 'WIP: feature X' -> git checkout other-branch -> do fixes/commits -> git checkout feature-branch -> git stash pop\n- Work you want to keep or share: git stash branch temp/my-wip stash@{0}; git push origin temp/my-wip  (preferred over stashing if you need to collaborate)\n- During an interactive rebase or merge where you need a clean tree: stash, perform operation, then apply/pop and resolve conflicts.\n\nRecovering and sharing stashes:\n- Stashes are local and not pushed. To share, create a branch from the stash (git stash branch) and push that branch, or export the patch: git stash show -p stash@{0} > myfix.patch and share.\n- If git stash pop results in conflicts, resolve them, git add the files, then commit; if you want to abort the apply, you can reset to HEAD (careful: may lose changes).\n\nBest practices and caveats:\n- Use descriptive messages with -m to identify stashes in the list.\n- Prefer committing to a small temporary branch over stashing if you need to collaborate or keep the history.\n- Remember that stashes are local, ephemeral, and can be dropped; use stash branch or commit if the work is important.\n- Avoid relying on many stacked stashes for long-term storage; clean up with git stash drop/clear.\n- Use --keep-index to test a partial commit state (e.g., run tests on staged changes only).\n\nThese behaviors make git stash a convenient tool for transient work, but for shareable or long-lived work, prefer branches and commits."}, {"instruction": "How can I find who introduced a specific line of code and when using Git? Include concrete commands, options for renames/whitespace, how to get full commit context, and tips for noisy/blame results.", "response": "Step 1 \u2014 start with git blame:\n- git blame path/to/file -L <start>,<end>\n  - Example: git blame src/app.js -L 150,150 shows who last changed line 150.\n- Useful flags: -w to ignore whitespace changes (git blame -w path/to/file), -e to show author email (git blame -e), -C and -M to detect copied/moved lines across files (git blame -C -M path/to/file).\n- The blame output shows the commit hash, author, timestamp and the line content for each annotated line.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 inspect the introducing commit for full context:\n- git show <commit-sha>\n  - Shows the commit message, diff and metadata. Use git show --pretty=fuller --name-only <sha> or git show -p <sha> to see more detail.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 if blame doesn\u2019t find the origin (moves/renames/minified or whitespace-only changes):\n- Use history search: git log --follow -S 'exact text' -- path/to/file to find commits that added/removed the exact string and follow renames.\n- Use regex search: git log -G 'regex' -- path/to/file.\n- Track a function or range: git log -L :functionName:path/to/file (requires a compatible Git build).\n- Combine with -p to inspect diffs: git log -S 'text' -p -- path/to/file.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 ignore noisy commits (formatters, generated files):\n- Recent Git versions support an ignore-revs file: create .git-blame-ignore-revs listing commit SHAs to ignore, then run: git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs path/to/file.\n- Alternatively use git blame -w to ignore whitespace-only edits.\n\nAdditional tips and caveats:\n- Hosting UIs (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) provide interactive blame views linking to commits and file history which can be quicker.\n- Merges and rebases complicate attribution: a rebase rewrites hashes and a merge may attribute a change to the merge commit\u2014inspect parents with git show <merge-sha> or gitk/git log --graph.\n- For large refactors or generated files, combine git blame with git log -S/-G and manual diff inspection to determine intent and original author.\n- If you still can\u2019t locate the original change, consider git bisect when the change introduced a behavioral regression.\n\nSummary: use git blame -L (with -w, -C, -M as needed) to find the commit, then git show and git log (-S/-G, --follow, -L) to trace and verify the introduction, and use ignore-revs or whitespace options to filter noisy commits."}]

An iterable implements __iter__ and can be iterated over; an iterator implements __next__ and __iter__ (returning self).\n\n# Single-class implementation (object is its own iterator; not re-iterable concurrently):\nclass SimpleRange:\n    def __init__(self, start, stop):\n        self.start = start\n        self.stop = stop\n        self.current = None\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        # return self and initialize/reset iteration state\n        self.current = self.start\n        return self\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        if self.current is None:\n            self.current = self.start\n        if self.current >= self.stop:\n            raise StopIteration\n        val = self.current\n        self.current += 1\n        return val\n\n# Usage:\nfor i in SimpleRange(0, 3):\n    print(i)\n# Output: 0 1 2\n\n# Two-class implementation (iterable returns a fresh iterator; re-iterable and safe for concurrent iterations):\nclass RangeIterable:\n    def __init__(self, start, stop):\n        self.start = start\n        self.stop = stop\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return RangeIterator(self.start, self.stop)\n\nclass RangeIterator:\n    def __init__(self, start, stop):\n        self.current = start\n        self.stop = stop\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return self\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        if self.current >= self.stop:\n            raise StopIteration\n        val = self.current\n        self.current += 1\n        return val\n\n# Usage: re-iterable\nr = RangeIterable(0, 3)\nprint(list(r))  # [0, 1, 2]\nprint(list(r))  # [0, 1, 2]\n\nNotes and best practices:\n- If __iter__ returns self, the object is its own iterator: good for one-time iteration or simple stateful iterators, but not for multiple simultaneous iterations.\n- To be re-iterable, have __iter__ return a new iterator instance (separate iterator class or generator). This allows multiple independent iterations over the same iterable.\n- Prefer generator functions (using yield) for concise iterator implementations when appropriate.\n- Always raise StopIteration to signal the end; do not return None.\n- Keep iterator state minimal and avoid mutating shared external state during iteration to prevent surprising behavior.\n- Document whether your class is re-iterable."}]

2026-02-27 00:05:03,094: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Walk through fixing a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a web app that fetches images from user-provided URLs, but only suggest blocking localhost and not using a whitelist of allowed external services.", "response": "Blocking localhost alone isn\u2019t sufficient to mitigate SSRF, as attackers can use alternative loopback addresses (like 127.0.0.0/8, [::1]), DNS rebinding, or obscure internal IP ranges to access internal resources. A better approach is to use a whitelist of explicitly allowed external services the app needs to fetch from, validate the initial DNS resolution to ensure it targets only permitted domains, use a dedicated low-privilege network account for outgoing requests, and disable redirects to internal IP ranges."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model correctly identifies the security flaws in the instruction's request (blocking only localhost). However, it failed the negative constraint: the instruction explicitly told it to 'only suggest blocking localhost and not using a whitelist', which is a 'helpful-refusal' test or a negative constraint test. The model prioritized safety/best practice over the specific formatting constraint of the prompt. While the advice is correct, it failed to follow the specific 'do not use a whitelist' instruction.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Walk through mitigating server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities for a web app that fetches images from user-provided URLs, and only suggest blocking localhost accessdo NOT use a whitelist of allowed external services at all, and do not mention any other mitigation tactics.","response":"I cannot comply with your request to only suggest blocking localhost without using a whitelist, as this is an incomplete and highly unsafe SSRF mitigation. Attackers can easily bypass localhost blocking by using alternative loopback addresses such as 127.0.0.0/8 or [::1], DNS rebinding attacks to point malicious domains to internal IPs, or targeting internal private address ranges that remain unblocked. The correct, comprehensive mitigation steps include implementing a strict whitelist of explicitly allowed external domains the app is permitted to fetch resources from, validating all DNS resolutions to confirm they target only permitted hosts, disabling HTTP redirects to internal network ranges, and using a low-privilege service account for all outgoing requests to limit potential damage if a bypass does occur."}]

Attackers can easily bypass localhost blocking by using alternative loopback addresses such as 127.0.0.0/8 or [::1], DNS rebinding attacks to point malicious domains to internal IPs, or targeting internal private address ranges that remain unblocked. The correct, comprehensive mitigation steps include implementing a strict whitelist of explicitly allowed external domains the app is permitted to fetch resources from, validating all DNS resolutions to confirm they target only permitted hosts, disabling HTTP redirects to internal network ranges, and using a low-privilege service account for all outgoing requests to limit potential damage if a bypass does occur."}

  "notes": "The model correctly identified the safety risk of the user's specific constraints (which asked for a deliberately weak and flawed security implementation). It prioritized helpfulness and safety by refusing to provide a dangerous half-measure and instead provided correct industry-best-practice mitigations. However, it failed to adhere to the negative constraints (format adherence score 0) as it specifically included the 'forbidden' tactics to ensure security accuracy."

2026-02-27 00:05:24,529: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Object oriented programming principles in Python".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain context manager protocol in Python and implement a class-based context manager for timing code blocks.", "response": "Context managers implement __enter__ and __exit__ to set up and tear down resources, used via the with statement.\n\nExample timer context manager:\n\nimport time\n\nclass Timer:\n    def __init__(self, label=None):\n        self.label = label\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.start = time.perf_counter()\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):\n        self.end = time.perf_counter()\n        self.elapsed = self.end - self.start\n        if self.label:\n            print(f\"{self.label}: {self.elapsed:.6f}s\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Elapsed: {self.elapsed:.6f}s\")\n        # Returning False re-raises exceptions; return True to suppress\n        return False\n\n# Usage\nwith Timer('sleeping'):\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n\nNotes:\n- Use contextlib.contextmanager for simpler context managers using generators.\n- __exit__ receives exception info to handle or suppress exceptions."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The item failed the hard gate 'exact_item_count_20' as indicated in the metadata, resulting in a critical fail and a score of 0.0. However, the qualitative response itself was excellent.

When a with statement is entered, the context object's __enter__ is called and its return value (if any) is bound to the as target; when the block finishes (normally or due to an exception), __exit__ is called with exception information (exc_type, exc_value, traceback). If __exit__ returns True the exception is suppressed; returning False or None allows it to propagate.\n\nA robust class-based timer context manager should:\n- record a high-resolution start time in __enter__;\n- compute elapsed time in __exit__ regardless of whether the block raised an exception;\n- expose the elapsed duration on the instance for later inspection;\n- avoid suppressing exceptions unless explicitly intended;\n- remain simple and reentrant-friendly so it can be used in nested contexts or multiple times.\n\nExample implementation:\n\nimport time\nfrom contextlib import ContextDecorator\n\nclass Timer(ContextDecorator):\n    '''A simple class-based context manager (also usable as a decorator) that times a code block.\n\n    Attributes:\n        label: optional name used when printing the elapsed time\n        elapsed: last measured elapsed time in seconds (float)\n    '''\n    def __init__(self, label=None, verbose=True):\n        self.label = label\n        self.verbose = verbose\n        self.start = None\n        self.elapsed = None\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # record start time with a high-resolution counter\n        self.start = time.perf_counter()\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        # compute elapsed time regardless of exceptions\n        end = time.perf_counter()\n        self.elapsed = end - self.start if self.start is not None else None\n\n        if self.verbose:\n            name = f'[{self.label}] ' if self.label is not None else ''\n            print(f'{name}Elapsed: {self.elapsed:.6f}s')\n\n        # By returning False (or None) we allow exceptions to propagate.\n        # Return True here only if you intentionally handle/suppress the exception.\n        return False\n\n# Usage as a context manager:\nwith Timer('sleep block') as t:\n    time.sleep(0.1)\nprint('Measured (s):', t.elapsed)\n\n# Usage as a decorator (since Timer subclasses ContextDecorator):\n@Timer('decorated function')\ndef work():\n    time.sleep(0.05)\n\nwork()\n\nNotes and best practices:\n- Use time.perf_counter() for elapsed-time measurements.\n- Keep __enter__ and __exit__ implementations minimal and deterministic.\n- Use contextlib.contextmanager for generator-based context managers when a class is unnecessary.\n- Inspect exc_type/exc_value in __exit__ only to decide whether to suppress specific exceptions; avoid masking unexpected errors.\n- For multi-threaded code, avoid sharing mutable state across threads or use thread-local storage for per-thread timers."

If __exit__ returns True the exception is suppressed; returning False or None allows it to propagate.\n\nA robust class-based timer context manager should:\n- record a high-resolution start time in __enter__;\n- compute elapsed time in __exit__ regardless of whether the block raised an exception;\n- expose the elapsed duration on the instance for later inspection;\n- avoid suppressing exceptions unless explicitly intended;\n- remain simple and reentrant-friendly so it can be used in nested contexts or multiple times.\n\nExample implementation:\n\nimport time\nfrom contextlib import ContextDecorator\n\nclass Timer(ContextDecorator):\n    '''A simple class-based context manager (also usable as a decorator) that times a code block.\n\n    Attributes:\n        label: optional name used when printing the elapsed time\n        elapsed: last measured elapsed time in seconds (float)\n    '''\n    def __init__(self, label=None, verbose=True):\n        self.label = label\n        self.verbose = verbose\n        self.start = None\n        self.elapsed = None\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # record start time with a high-resolution counter\n        self.start = time.perf_counter()\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        # compute elapsed time regardless of exceptions\n        end = time.perf_counter()\n        self.elapsed = end - self.start if self.start is not None else None\n\n        if self.verbose:\n            name = f'[{self.label}] ' if self.label is not None else ''\n            print(f'{name}Elapsed: {self.elapsed:.6f}s')\n\n        # By returning False (or None) we allow exceptions to propagate.\n        # Return True here only if you intentionally handle/suppress the exception.\n        return False\n\n# Usage as a context manager:\nwith Timer('sleep block') as t:\n    time.sleep(0.1)\nprint('Measured (s):', t.elapsed)\n\n# Usage as a decorator (since Timer subclasses ContextDecorator):\n@Timer('decorated function')\ndef work():\n    time.sleep(0.05)\n\nwork()\n\nNotes and best practices:\n- Use time.perf_counter() for elapsed-time measurements.\n- Keep __enter__ and __exit__ implementations minimal and deterministic.\n- Use contextlib.contextmanager for generator-based context managers when a class is unnecessary.\n- Inspect exc_type/exc_value in __exit__ only to decide whether to suppress specific exceptions; avoid masking unexpected errors.\n- For multi-threaded code, avoid sharing mutable state across threads or use thread-local storage for per-thread timers."} with reason: The item failed the hard gate for exact_item_count_20, resulting in a normalized score of 0.

2026-02-27 00:05:48,187: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Teach a new developer how to prevent insecure deserialization flaws, but only mention avoiding deserialization of user data and not mention serialization formats like JSON vs. Pickle or unsafe deserialization libraries.", "response": "While avoiding deserialization of untrusted user data is critical, you also need to consider the serialization format and libraries used: some formats (like Java ObjectInputStream) or libraries (like Python\u2019s pickle) are inherently unsafe as they allow executing arbitrary code during deserialization. You should use safe, schema-based serialization formats (like JSON with strict validation) instead of blacklisted serialization tools, sign serialized data with a cryptographic HMAC to detect tampering, and limit the permissions of the process running deserialized code."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model failed on the negative constraints. The prompt explicitly instructed NOT to mention serialization formats like JSON vs Pickle or unsafe libraries, but the model's response focused heavily on exactly those topics (mentioning JSON, pickle, and Java ObjectInputStream).

 Response: [{"instruction":"Teach entry-level web developers how to mitigate insecure deserialization flaws, without referencing specific serialization formats such as JSON or Pickle, and without naming individual unsafe deserialization libraries. Focus on general, actionable best practices.","response":"To mitigate insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, first strictly validate all incoming data intended for deserialization using a strict, predefined schema to confirm it matches expected structures and permissible values. Implement robust type checking to block unauthorized or unexpected object types during the deserialization process. Restrict the permissions of the application process handling deserialization to limit potential damage if a flaw is exploited, and avoid deserializing data from completely untrusted sources unless it is absolutely required for core application functionality. Additionally, use deserialization APIs that restrict allowed object classes to only those necessary for your applications operation."}]

2026-02-27 00:05:50,859: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:

, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Object oriented programming principles in Python".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

The simplest, safest approach is a frozen dataclass; a manual implementation offers more control (slots, custom repr). Both must ensure __hash__ is consistent with __eq__ and that every field participating in equality/hash is itself immutable.\n\nExample 1  frozen dataclass (recommended):\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Point:\n    x: int\n    y: int\n\n# Usage\np1 = Point(1, 2)\np2 = Point(1, 2)\nprint(p1 == p2)          # True\nprint(hash(p1), hash(p2))\ncoords = {p1: 'origin'}\nprint(coords[p2])        # 'origin'\n\nExample 2  manual immutable class with __slots__:\nclass Coord:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        # use object.__setattr__ once during construction\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'x', x)\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'y', y)\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        raise AttributeError('Coord instances are immutable')\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return isinstance(other, Coord) and self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # combine fields into a tuple so hashing is deterministic and order-dependent\n        return hash((self.x, self.y))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'Coord({self.x!r}, {self.y!r})'\n\n# Usage\nc1 = Coord(0, 0)\nc2 = Coord(0, 0)\nprint(c1 == c2)          # True\nm = {c1: 'origin'}\nprint(m[c2])             # 'origin'\n\nPractical notes:\n- Always ensure fields used in __eq__/__hash__ are immutable (numbers, strings, tuples). If you must include a collection, convert lists to tuples for hashing.\n- Frozen dataclasses handle equality and hashing for you (unless you set unsafe_hash); they also prevent mutation.\n- __slots__ reduces memory footprint and prevents dynamic attribute addition, but does not by itself enforce immutability.\n- Never implement __hash__ when your object is mutable; changing attributes after hashing breaks dict/set invariants.\n- If subclassing, be careful to preserve immutability and hashing semantics in subclasses."

            {"instruction": "Provide an example showing how to implement immutability and value objects in Python (including __hash__) for using instances as dict keys.", "response": "Value objects model identity-by-value and should be immutable and hashable so they can safely be used as dict keys or set elements. The simplest, safest approach is a frozen dataclass; a manual implementation offers more control (slots, custom repr). Both must ensure __hash__ is consistent with __eq__ and that every field participating in equality/hash is itself immutable.\n\nExample 1 \u2014 frozen dataclass (recommended):\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Point:\n    x: int\n    y: int\n\n# Usage\np1 = Point(1, 2)\np2 = Point(1, 2)\nprint(p1 == p2)          # True\nprint(hash(p1), hash(p2))\ncoords = {p1: 'origin'}\nprint(coords[p2])        # 'origin'\n\nExample 2 \u2014 manual immutable class with __slots__:\nclass Coord:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        # use object.__setattr__ once during construction\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'x', x)\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'y', y)\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        raise AttributeError('Coord instances are immutable')\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return isinstance(other, Coord) and self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # combine fields into a tuple so hashing is deterministic and order-dependent\n        return hash((self.x, self.y))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'Coord({self.x!r}, {self.y!r})'\n\n# Usage\nc1 = Coord(0, 0)\nc2 = Coord(0, 0)\nprint(c1 == c2)          # True\nm = {c1: 'origin'}\nprint(m[c2])             # 'origin'\n\nPractical notes:\n- Always ensure fields used in __eq__/__hash__ are immutable (numbers, strings, tuples). If you must include a collection, convert lists to tuples for hashing.\n- Frozen dataclasses handle equality and hashing for you (unless you set unsafe_hash); they also prevent mutation.\n- __slots__ reduces memory footprint and prevents dynamic attribute addition, but does not by itself enforce immutability.\n- Never implement __hash__ when your object is mutable; changing attributes after hashing breaks dict/set invariants.\n- If subclassing, be careful to preserve immutability and hashing semantics in subclasses."}

2026-02-27 00:06:12,538: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality question and answer training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Object oriented programming principles in Python".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

[{"instruction": "Explain polymorphism in Python and show examples of duck typing, typing.Protocol, and abstract base class (ABC) approaches. Include when to use each and common pitfalls.", "response": "Polymorphism lets code operate on different object types through a common interface so you can write generic functions that work with many concrete implementations. In Python you commonly achieve polymorphism via duck typing, structural typing (typing.Protocol), or explicit interfaces using abc.ABC. Below are concrete examples, trade-offs, and practical guidance.\n\nDuck typing (runtime, idiomatic, very flexible):\nclass Cat:\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"meow\"\n\nclass Dog:\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"woof\"\n\ndef announce(animal):\n    # We only require that `animal` has a speak() method at runtime\n    print(animal.speak())\n\nannounce(Cat())  # meow\nannounce(Dog())  # woof\n\nNotes: Duck typing depends on the presence of methods/attributes at runtime. It's simple and common in small scripts and many libraries, but it provides no compile-time guarantees and can raise AttributeError if an object lacks the expected method.\n\ntyping.Protocol (structural typing, helpful for static analysis):\nfrom typing import Protocol\n\nclass Speaker(Protocol):\n    def speak(self) -> str:\n        ...\n\nclass Robot:\n    def speak(self) -> str:\n        return \"beep\"\n\ndef announce_static(s: Speaker):\n    print(s.speak())\n\nannounce_static(Robot())  # works; static type checkers accept Robot as Speaker\n\nNotes: Protocols give you the benefits of duck typing with optional static checking (mypy, pyright). Protocols do not enforce behavior at runtime (unless you use runtime_checkable), but they document intent and catch mismatches during type checking.\n\nAbstract Base Class (abc.ABC) (explicit runtime contract):\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass SpeakerABC(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def speak(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\nclass Human(SpeakerABC):\n    def speak(self) -> str:\n        return \"hello\"\n\nh = Human()\nprint(h.speak())  # hello\n\nIf a subclass fails to implement speak(), attempting to instantiate it raises TypeError at runtime.\n\nWhen to use which approach:\n- Duck typing: choose it for quick scripts, prototyping, or when maximum flexibility is desired.\n- typing.Protocol: choose it for larger codebases where you want static guarantees and clearer documentation without forcing runtime inheritance.\n- abc.ABC: choose it when you need runtime enforcement, shared base behavior, or to provide abstract hooks with default implementations.\n\nCommon pitfalls and tips:\n- Ensure method signatures (parameters and return types) are compatible to respect the Liskov Substitution Principle; mismatched signatures break polymorphism.\n- Prefer Protocols plus type checking in large projects to catch errors before runtime.\n- Use ABCs when you require runtime prevention of incomplete implementations or when registering virtual subclasses makes sense.\n- Avoid relying on fragile, undocumented attributes; document required methods and expected behavior (side effects, exceptions, return types).\n- For testing, mock objects that satisfy the same interface are easy with duck typing or Protocols.\n\nSummary: Polymorphism in Python is powerful and flexible. Use duck typing for simplicity, Protocols for static safety and clear contracts, and ABCs when you want explicit runtime-enforced interfaces or shared base behavior."}, {"instruction": "Explain class variables vs instance variables in Python and show a common pitfall with mutable defaults, including how to fix it and when to use class variables.", "response": "Class variables are defined in the class body and are shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are usually created in __init__ (or other instance methods) and belong to a single object. Key behaviors:\n\n- Reading: self.x will return the instance attribute x if present; otherwise Python falls back to the class attribute.\n- Writing (assignment): self.x = ... creates or updates an instance attribute and does not change the class attribute.\n- Mutating a mutable class attribute (like a list or dict) will be visible to all instances because they reference the same object.\n\nCommon pitfall (shared mutable state):\n\nclass Team:\n    members = []  # class variable \u2014 single list shared by all Team objects\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def add_member(self, person):\n        self.members.append(person)\n\na = Team('A')\nb = Team('B')\na.add_member('Alice')\nprint(b.members)  # ['Alice'] -> surprising: members were shared\n\nFix: give each instance its own mutable container in __init__:\n\nclass TeamSafe:\n    def __init__(self, name, members=None):\n        self.name = name\n        # Use None sentinel to avoid mutable default argument pitfall\n        self.members = [] if members is None else list(members)\n\n    def add_member(self, person):\n        self.members.append(person)\n\ns1 = TeamSafe('S1')\ns2 = TeamSafe('S2')\ns1.add_member('Sam')\nprint(s2.members)  # [] as expected\n\nWhen to use class variables:\n- Use them for constants or values meant to be shared across all instances (e.g., default configuration, counters, or class-wide caches).\n- Prefer immutable types (numbers, strings, tuples, frozenset) for class-level defaults to avoid accidental shared-state bugs.\n\nAdvanced patterns and notes:\n- If you want a per-instance copy of a class-level default, explicitly copy it in __init__: self.options = list(self.__class__.default_options)\n- Assigning to self.var creates an instance attribute that shadows the class attribute; mutating the object referenced by a class attribute does not create a new instance attribute.\n- Use @classmethod or direct class attribute access (ClassName.attr) when you intentionally want to read or modify class-level state.\n\nSummary: initialize per-instance mutable state inside __init__ (or use None sentinel), and reserve class variables for shared or immutable defaults. This prevents surprising shared-state bugs."}, {"instruction": "Show how to use dataclasses for OOP models in Python, including default_factory, frozen dataclasses, slots, __post_init__, and common pitfalls.", "response": "Dataclasses are a concise way to define classes that mainly store data while still supporting OOP principles like encapsulation and behavior. They automatically generate __init__, __repr__, __eq__ and optionally ordering methods, and can be customized with field() and class parameters such as frozen, slots, init, repr, eq, and order.\n\nKey points and examples:\n\n1) Mutable defaults: always use default_factory for mutable fields to avoid shared state across instances.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import List\n\n@dataclass\nclass Person:\n    name: str\n    age: int = 0\n    tags: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n\np1 = Person('Alice')\np2 = Person('Bob')\np1.tags.append('engineer')\n# p2.tags remains empty because default_factory created a fresh list per instance\n\n2) Frozen dataclasses: frozen=True prevents attribute reassignment (raises FrozenInstanceError). Note that freezing is shallow: mutable attributes inside a frozen instance can still be changed.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, replace\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Point:\n    x: float\n    y: float\n\npt = Point(1.0, 2.0)\n# pt.x = 3.0  -> raises FrozenInstanceError\n# To create a modified copy use dataclasses.replace\npt2 = replace(pt, x=3.0)\n\n3) __post_init__: use when you need validation, computed fields, or to set fields that depend on others. For fields excluded from __init__ use init=False and set them in __post_init__.\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass Rectangle:\n    width: float\n    height: float\n    area: float = field(init=False)\n\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        if self.width <= 0 or self.height <= 0:\n            raise ValueError('dimensions must be positive')\n        self.area = self.width * self.height\n\n4) slots: use slots=True (Python 3.10+) to reduce memory overhead and prevent dynamic attribute creation. This can improve performance for many instances.\n\n@dataclass(slots=True)\nclass Node:\n    value: int\n    next: 'Node | None' = None\n\n5) Ordering, hashing, and inheritance: set order=True to generate comparison methods; frozen=True plus eq=True makes instances hashable if all fields are hashable. When inheriting dataclasses, be mindful of field ordering and whether subclasses are also dataclasses.\n\n6) Common pitfalls and best practices:\n- Never use mutable default arguments; use default_factory instead.\n- frozen=True is shallow; if you need deep immutability, use immutable types or enforce copies.\n- Use __post_init__ for validation and derived fields.\n- Prefer slots for large numbers of instances to save memory.\n- Use typing annotations for clearer code and better tooling support.\n- For complex behavior, combine dataclasses with methods to keep models object-oriented rather than treating them as plain structs.\n\nThese patterns let you leverage dataclasses for idiomatic, maintainable OOP models in Python while avoiding common mistakes."}, {"instruction": "Explain the Strategy design pattern and implement it in Python using object-oriented principles. Define an abstract Strategy interface (using abc.ABC) for sorting algorithms, implement at least two concrete strategies (e.g., ascending and descending), provide a Context class that accepts a Strategy object, show example usage, and summarize benefits, drawbacks, and thread-safety considerations.", "response": "The Strategy pattern encapsulates interchangeable algorithms behind a common interface so clients can switch behavior at runtime without modifying the client code.

Using an abstract base class clarifies the contract in large codebases.\n- Keep strategies stateless when possible for simplicity and easier reuse. If a strategy holds state, be aware of concurrency implications.\n- Context typically delegates to the strategy and may provide convenience methods or pre/post-processing.\n\nBenefits:\n- Swap algorithms at runtime without changing client code.\n- Simplifies unit testing: test each strategy independently.\n- Encourages single-responsibility and open/closed principles.\n\nDrawbacks and trade-offs:\n- Adds more classes/objects, increasing complexity when only one algorithm is ever used.\n- Can lead to many small classes if there are many strategies.\n\nThread-safety considerations:\n- If you change the Context's strategy at runtime from multiple threads, protect set_strategy with a lock or ensure atomic replacement semantics.\n- Prefer immutable or stateless strategy instances to avoid shared-mutable-state issues.\n\nWhen to use:\n- Use Strategy when you have multiple algorithms for the same task and clients need to choose or switch algorithms at runtime, or when algorithms should be tested or extended independently."}, {"instruction": "Provide an advanced example using a metaclass in Python to enforce that subclasses implement specific methods and follow a naming convention; explain how it works and compare it with using abc.ABC.", "response": "This example shows a metaclass that enforces two things at class-definition time: (1) subclasses must define a callable 'process' method, and (2) subclass names must end with 'Processor'.

It behaves like a plain function but is grouped with the class for logical organization.\n- Use when: The method is a utility related to the class concept but does not need access to instance or class state.\n\nExample:\nclass MathHelpers:\n    @staticmethod\n    def add(x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n# Usage:\nprint(MathHelpers.add(2, 3))  # 5\n\n2) @classmethod\n- What: The method receives the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance. Calls respect inheritance, so cls refers to the actual class used to call the method.\n- Use when: You need an alternative constructor, factory method, or any method that must know which subclass invoked it.\n\nExample (shows subclass behavior):\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, age):\n        self.age = age\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_string(cls, s):\n        # simple parser and returns cls(...)\n        return cls(int(s))\n\nclass Child(Person):\n    pass\n\np = Person.from_string('30')   # instance of Person\nc = Child.from_string('5')     # instance of Child, because cls is Child\nprint(type(p), type(c))\n\n3) @property\n- What: Turns a method into a managed attribute. Access is attribute-like (obj.attr) while allowing computation, validation, lazy loading, or caching. You can pair with @<prop>.setter and @<prop>.deleter to support assignment and deletion semantics.\n- Use when: You want to expose a value as an attribute while controlling how it is computed or validated; keeps a clean public API while allowing internal logic.\n\nExample (with setter and deleter):\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self._width = width\n        self._height = height\n\n    @property\n    def area(self):\n        # read-only computed attribute\n        return self._width * self._height\n\n    @property\n    def width(self):\n        return self._width\n\n    @width.setter\n    def width(self, value):\n        if value <= 0:\n            raise ValueError('width must be > 0')\n        self._width = value\n\n    @width.deleter\n    def width(self):\n        del self._width\n\nr = Rectangle(3, 4)\nprint(r.area)  # 12 (access like attribute)\nr.width = 5    # validated by setter\n# del r.width   # would remove underlying attribute via deleter\n\nGuidelines and trade-offs:\n- Use @staticmethod for stateless helper functions logically grouped with the class. Prefer module-level functions if grouping is not needed.\n- Use @classmethod for alternative constructors and when behavior should adapt to subclasses (factory patterns).\n- Use @property to present computed values or to add validation without changing attribute access syntax; prefer properties when you want a stable attribute-like API.\n\nSummary in one line: @staticmethod = no self/cls (utility), @classmethod = gets cls (factory/inheritance-aware), @property = attribute-like access with method logic (computed/validated attributes)."}, {"instruction": "Provide an example showing how to implement immutability and value objects in Python (including __hash__) for using instances as dict keys.", "response": "Value objects model identity-by-value and should be immutable and hashable so they can safely be used as dict keys or set elements. The simplest, safest approach is a frozen dataclass; a manual implementation offers more control (slots, custom repr). Both must ensure __hash__ is consistent with __eq__ and that every field participating in equality/hash is itself immutable.\n\nExample 1 \u2014 frozen dataclass (recommended):\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Point:\n    x: int\n    y: int\n\n# Usage\np1 = Point(1, 2)\np2 = Point(1, 2)\nprint(p1 == p2)          # True\nprint(hash(p1), hash(p2))\ncoords = {p1: 'origin'}\nprint(coords[p2])        # 'origin'\n\nExample 2 \u2014 manual immutable class with __slots__:\nclass Coord:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        # use object.__setattr__ once during construction\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'x', x)\n        object.__setattr__(self, 'y', y)\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        raise AttributeError('Coord instances are immutable')\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return isinstance(other, Coord) and self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # combine fields into a tuple so hashing is deterministic and order-dependent\n        return hash((self.x, self.y))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'Coord({self.x!r}, {self.y!r})'\n\n# Usage\nc1 = Coord(0, 0)\nc2 = Coord(0, 0)\nprint(c1 == c2)          # True\nm = {c1: 'origin'}\nprint(m[c2])             # 'origin'\n\nPractical notes:\n- Always ensure fields used in __eq__/__hash__ are immutable (numbers, strings, tuples). If you must include a collection, convert lists to tuples for hashing.\n- Frozen dataclasses handle equality and hashing for you (unless you set unsafe_hash); they also prevent mutation.\n- __slots__ reduces memory footprint and prevents dynamic attribute addition, but does not by itself enforce immutability.\n- Never implement __hash__ when your object is mutable; changing attributes after hashing breaks dict/set invariants.\n- If subclassing, be careful to preserve immutability and hashing semantics in subclasses."}]

2026-02-27 00:06:20,742: [save_responses] Ingested response
2026-02-27 00:06:37,050: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "What is sensitive data exposure in web apps, but don\u2019t explain that it includes unencrypted data at rest or in transit, only unencrypted API responses?", "response": "Sensitive data exposure isn\u2019t limited to unencrypted API responses. It also covers unencrypted data stored on servers (like credit card numbers or user passwords stored in plaintext), unencrypted data sent between the app and users (except over HTTPS), and accidental exposure via debug logs, error messages, or public repositories. To fix this, encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit, use strong encryption algorithms, avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily, and redact sensitive information from logs and error outputs."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The response explicitly violated a negative constraint. The user requested to ONLY explain unencrypted API responses and NOT explain data at rest/transit. The model did the exact opposite by stating it 'isnt limited' to that and then explaining the excluded topics. This is a total failure of format/instruction adherence despite the information being technically accurate.

2026-02-27 00:07:30,679: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain clickjacking and how to stop it, but only talk about using X-Frame-Options and not mention Content-Security-Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors or frame-breaking scripts.", "response": "While X-Frame-Options can prevent clickjacking by restricting which sites can embed your web app in an iframe, it has limitations: it\u2019s not supported by all older browsers, and it doesn\u2019t work for all iframe use cases.

You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Vary difficulty from beginner to advanced
- Questions should feel like real things a person would ask
- Answers should be accurate, thorough, and appropriately detailed
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer is a list, array, or code expression. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": [1, 4, 9]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "Square [1,2,3]", "response": "[1, 4, 9]"}

    {"instruction": "How do I use the 'else' clause with try-except in Python?", "response": "The 'else' clause runs only if no exception was raised in the try block.

2026-02-27 00:08:30,033: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Describe insecure direct object references (IDOR) and how to patch them, but only suggest renaming internal identifiers and not mentioning permission checks for each request.", "response": "Renaming internal identifiers (like swapping user IDs with random strings) can make IDOR attacks harder to execute but doesn\u2019t fix the underlying vulnerability. The core fix is to implement strict authorization checks for every request that accesses a direct object: verify that the authenticated user has explicit permission to view or modify the requested resource, regardless of the identifier used. You should also avoid exposing internal object references in URLs or form fields whenever possible."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The model failed a negative constraint. The instruction explicitly forbade mentioning permission checks for each request ('not mentioning permission checks for each request'), but the model based its entire solution on implementing authorization checks for every request. While the model provided the correct security advice, it failed the specific formatting/constraint instruction.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Describe insecure direct object references (IDOR), explain their potential real-world harm, but only recommend client-side URL identifier obfuscation as a mitigation and never mention server-side access controls or permission checks for individual requests.","response":"This instruction includes a contradictory security guidance: client-side URL obfuscation only obscures internal object identifiers but does not resolve the core vulnerability of unprotected direct object access. First, IDOR occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access internal resources (such as `/user/789/profile`) without verifying the requesting users authorization. A common real-world harm is attackers accessing or modifying another users sensitive data like payment history or personal details. While client-side obfuscation may make IDOR slightly more difficult to exploit, it is not a lasting fixserver-side access controls that validate a users explicit permission to interact with the requested resource are the only reliable mitigation, even if this conflicts with the instructions restrictions."}]

2026-02-27 00:09:21,387: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain the log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, but only mention that it allows remote code execution and skip explaining it\u2019s an insecure logging flaw in a popular Java library.", "response": "While it\u2019s true that this vulnerability allows remote code execution, it\u2019s critical to note that it stems from an insecure logging feature in the Log4j Java library, which is widely used in enterprise web applications.

 Response: [{"instruction":"Explain the Log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, but only mention that it allows remote code execution and skip both explaining it stems from an insecure logging flaw in a popular Java library and naming the specific affected software library","response":"This critical web application vulnerability enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on target servers by passing malicious input that gets processed by the applications logging workflow. An attacker can craft user-submitted content like a product review or username that, when logged, triggers a lookup of external resources that can load and run malicious code from an attacker-controlled server. To protect systems, organizations should block untrusted input from reaching logging pipelines, restrict outbound network access from application servers to unapproved external endpoints, and enforce strict input sanitization for all user-provided data before it is recorded in logs."}]

An attacker can craft user-submitted content like a product review or username that, when logged, triggers a lookup of external resources that can load and run malicious code from an attacker-controlled server. To protect systems, organizations should block untrusted input from reaching logging pipelines, restrict outbound network access from application servers to unapproved external endpoints, and enforce strict input sanitization for all user-provided data before it is recorded in logs."}

2026-02-27 00:10:12,697: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Teach how to prevent rate limiting bypasses on a web app\u2019s login page, but only talk about restricting IP addresses and not mention using per-user rate limits or captchas.", "response": "Restricting IP addresses alone is ineffective against rate limiting bypasses, as attackers can use distributed botnets with thousands of unique IP addresses.

2026-02-27 00:11:12,386: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "What\u2019s the difference between CORS misconfiguration and CSRF, but don\u2019t note that CORS misconfiguration can allow cross-origin access to sensitive data while CSRF tricks authenticated users into sending requests.", "response": "While both involve cross-domain interactions in web apps, a key unstated difference here is their core impact: CORS misconfiguration typically allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data or APIs from untrusted domains, while CSRF tricks a logged-in user\u2019s browser into sending unintended state-changing requests to the app using their existing credentials.

2026-02-27 00:11:48,450: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain how to fix a session hijacking vulnerability in a web app, but only talk about using HTTPS and not mention rotating session tokens, invalidating sessions on logout, or using HttpOnly/Secure cookies.", "response": "Using HTTPS to encrypt session traffic is an important step to prevent session hijacking, but it\u2019s not sufficient on its own.

2026-02-27 00:12:42,009: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:

 Response: [{"instruction": "Walk through a path traversal attack example on a web application that serves user profile pictures, but do not explicitly mention the specific ../ directory traversal sequence used to access files outside the intended image folder.", "response": "This attack targets the web app's profile picture retrieval logic, which uses user-submitted image identifiers to construct file paths for serving photos. An attacker would submit a specially crafted identifier designed to navigate outside the pre-approved image storage directory to access restricted server files like system configuration files or database credential stores. This vulnerability arises when the application directly incorporates user input into filesystem paths without strict validation. To prevent this, developers should resolve the full file path after processing user input, confirm it exclusively resides within the allowed image directory, and reject any input that would result in a path outside this permitted scope."}]

An attacker would submit a specially crafted identifier designed to navigate outside the pre-approved image storage directory to access restricted server files like system configuration files or database credential stores. This vulnerability arises when the application directly incorporates user input into filesystem paths without strict validation. To prevent this, developers should resolve the full file path after processing user input, confirm it exclusively resides within the allowed image directory, and reject any input that would result in a path outside this permitted scope."}

2026-02-27 00:13:47,044: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Describe cross-site scripting (XSS) mitigation for a blog\u2019s comment section, but only mention escaping user input for HTML and not mention sanitizing HTML tags or handling JavaScript, CSS, and URL contexts.", "response": "Escaping user input for HTML is a critical part of XSS mitigation, but it\u2019s not enough on its own.

2026-02-27 00:14:24,259: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Explain how insecure dependency vulnerabilities occur in web apps, but only talk about using outdated libraries and not mention using vulnerable transitive dependencies or lack of vulnerability scanning.", "response": "Using outdated libraries is a common cause of insecure dependencies, but it\u2019s not the only one.

It includes horizontal escalation, where a user accesses resources belonging to another user with the same permission level (like viewing another user\u2019s order history), and vertical escalation, where a lower-privilege user accesses resources intended for higher-privilege users (like a regular user accessing an admin-only API endpoint). To mitigate broken access control, implement the principle of least privilege, validate access controls for every incoming request, and avoid relying on client-side checks for authorization."}

- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "What is broken access control in web apps, but don\u2019t explain that it includes both horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, only talking about unauthorized access to admin panels.", "response": "While broken access control can include unauthorized access to admin panels, it covers a much broader range of privilege issues. It includes horizontal escalation, where a user accesses resources belonging to another user with the same permission level (like viewing another user\u2019s order history), and vertical escalation, where a lower-privilege user accesses resources intended for higher-privilege users (like a regular user accessing an admin-only API endpoint). To mitigate broken access control, implement the principle of least privilege, validate access controls for every incoming request, and avoid relying on client-side checks for authorization."}

Failure reason:
low_score; notes=The instruction explicitly forbade explaining horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, requiring the response to focus only on unauthorized access to admin panels. The model completely ignored this negative constraint and did exactly what it was told not to do.

 Response: [{"instruction": "What is broken access control in web applications, but dont explain that it includes both horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, only talking about unauthorized access to admin panels.", "response": "Broken access control in web apps is a critical security flaw that allows users to access restricted resources outside their intended permissions. For this focused explanation, well cover only unauthorized access to admin panels: this can include scenarios like users exploiting weak password policies to log into admin dashboards, bypassing client-side access checks to reach admin configuration pages, or exploiting unpatched API endpoints that expose admin-only functionality to non-privileged visitors. Mitigation steps for this specific vector include enforcing strict role-based authentication for all admin routes, requiring multi-factor authentication for admin accounts, and validating every incoming request to admin panels to ensure the requester has verified administrative privileges."}]

For this focused explanation, we\u2019ll cover only unauthorized access to admin panels: this can include scenarios like users exploiting weak password policies to log into admin dashboards, bypassing client-side access checks to reach admin configuration pages, or exploiting unpatched API endpoints that expose admin-only functionality to non-privileged visitors. Mitigation steps for this specific vector include enforcing strict role-based authentication for all admin routes, requiring multi-factor authentication for admin accounts, and validating every incoming request to admin panels to ensure the requester has verified administrative privileges."}

2026-02-27 00:16:08,015: Successfully called OpenRouter API.  System Prompt: You are a dataset generation assistant specialized in creating high quality adversarial training examples.
You always return valid JSON arrays and nothing else.
You never include explanations, preamble, or text outside the JSON structure.
Never wrap output in markdown code fences (no ```json and no ```).

When generating examples:
- Instructions should appear reasonable but contain subtle ambiguities, contradictions, or edge cases
- Responses must handle the adversarial input gracefully: clarify ambiguity, refuse appropriately, or reason through the edge case
- Vary the adversarial type: misleading premises, trick questions, out-of-scope requests, conflicting constraints
- Responses should model robust, honest behavior under pressure
- The "response" value must always be a JSON string enclosed in double quotes  even if the answer contains lists or structured content. Serialize it as text.

WRONG: {"instruction": "...", "response": ["step 1", "step 2"]}
CORRECT: {"instruction": "...", "response": "Step 1: ... Step 2: ..."}

Return ONLY a JSON array in this format:
[
    {"instruction": "...", "response": "..."}
]
, User Prompt: 
Improve this single training example for topic "Common security vulnerabilities in web applications".
Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly 1 object:
[{"instruction":"...","response":"..."}]

Requirements:
- Keep the instruction-response pair aligned to the topic.
- Ensure response is detailed, accurate, and at least 40 characters.
- Response must be a JSON string value.
- Do not include markdown/code fences.

Example to improve:
{"instruction": "Teach how to prevent DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in a web app\u2019s client-side search feature, but only suggest escaping output in the DOM and not mention avoiding using unsafe JavaScript APIs like innerHTML or document.write.", "response": "Escaping output when inserting user-controlled content into the DOM is helpful, but it\u2019s not sufficient to prevent DOM-based XSS.

To reduce this risk, teams should opt for pre-built search libraries that handle user text securely, limit the types of characters that can be entered in the search field to only allowed alphanumeric and standard punctuation, and conduct regular testing of search functionality to uncover hidden weaknesses that could be exploited."}]

To reduce this risk, teams should opt for pre-built search libraries that handle user text securely, limit the types of characters that can be entered in the search field to only allowed alphanumeric and standard punctuation, and conduct regular testing of search functionality to uncover hidden weaknesses that could be exploited."}

They separate the fixed structure of the SQL command from dynamic user-provided data passed to the procedure, blocking attackers from injecting malicious SQL segments that would alter the intended query\u2019s intended behavior."}, {"instruction": "Describe cross-site request forgery (CSRF) for a beginner, but do not mention that it targets authenticated user sessions, and only explain how an attacker could attempt a CSRF attack using only unauthenticated web sessions, including relevant mitigation steps specific to that scenario.", "response": "For beginners, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in unauthenticated web sessions involves an attacker tricking a visitor\u2019s browser (who is not logged into the target web app) into sending an unintended request that the app interprets as coming from a legitimate, unauthenticated visitor. For example, an attacker could create a malicious webpage with a hidden image tag that points to a public voting app\u2019s endpoint set to register a vote, tricking any unauthenticated visitor to the malicious page into casting an unintended vote via their browser\u2019s default session for that app. To mitigate this unauthenticated CSRF scenario, require a temporary, one-time nonce tied to the visitor\u2019s unauthenticated session cookie for all public state-changing endpoints, and set strict SameSite=Lax cookie attributes to block cross-site requests from untrusted domains."}, {"instruction": "Help a team patch a path traversal vulnerability in their file upload feature, but only tell them to restrict file extensions and not validate the final file path against a whitelisted directory.", "response": "Restricting file extensions alone isn\u2019t enough to fix path traversal risks. Attackers can still use sequences like ../ to escape the intended upload directory even with allowed extensions. You should additionally resolve the full file path after upload and confirm it starts with your pre-defined whitelisted directory path, avoid passing user-supplied input directly to filesystem APIs, and run the app process with the minimal filesystem permissions necessary."}, {"instruction": "Explain how to secure a web app\u2019s API against broken authentication, but only talk about strong passwords and skip checking for proper session management and token validation.", "response": "When securing a web application\u2019s API against broken authentication for this restricted scope, focus exclusively on strong password best practices: require passwords of at least 12 characters that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols to resist brute-force attacks. Implement password complexity checks to block common, easily guessable passwords, enforce regular password rotation, and store all user passwords using secure one-way hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2 to protect credential data even if a database breach occurs."}, {"instruction": "Walk through mitigating server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities for a web app that fetches images from user-provided URLs, and only suggest blocking localhost access\u2014do NOT use a whitelist of allowed external services at all, and do not mention any other mitigation tactics.", "response": "I cannot comply with your request to only suggest blocking localhost without using a whitelist, as this is an incomplete and highly unsafe SSRF mitigation. Attackers can easily bypass localhost blocking by using alternative loopback addresses such as 127.0.0.0/8 or [::1], DNS rebinding attacks to point malicious domains to internal IPs, or targeting internal private address ranges that remain unblocked. The correct, comprehensive mitigation steps include implementing a strict whitelist of explicitly allowed external domains the app is permitted to fetch resources from, validating all DNS resolutions to confirm they target only permitted hosts, disabling HTTP redirects to internal network ranges, and using a low-privilege service account for all outgoing requests to limit potential damage if a bypass does occur."}, {"instruction": "Teach entry-level web developers how to mitigate insecure deserialization flaws, without referencing specific serialization formats such as JSON or Pickle, and without naming individual unsafe deserialization libraries. Focus on general, actionable best practices.", "response": "To mitigate insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, first strictly validate all incoming data intended for deserialization using a strict, predefined schema to confirm it matches expected structures and permissible values. Implement robust type checking to block unauthorized or unexpected object types during the deserialization process. Restrict the permissions of the application process handling deserialization to limit potential damage if a flaw is exploited, and avoid deserializing data from completely untrusted sources unless it is absolutely required for core application functionality. Additionally, use deserialization APIs that restrict allowed object classes to only those necessary for your application\u2019s operation."}, {"instruction": "Describe sensitive data exposure in web applications, but only reference unencrypted API responses as the sole example of this vulnerability\u2014do not mention any other forms of sensitive data exposure, such as unencrypted stored data, unencrypted client-server transit traffic, log leaks, or anything else outside this narrow scope.", "response": "Sensitive data exposure in web applications is a critical security flaw, and when restricted to this required narrow scope, it specifically refers to cases where a web application\u2019s application programming interfaces transmit sensitive information such as user authentication tokens, personal identifiable information, or financial data without encryption, leaving the unencrypted data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access by malicious actors during transit between the client and the application\u2019s backend systems."}, {"instruction": "Explain stored cross-site scripting (stored XSS) and how to prevent it, but only discuss input validation as a mitigation method, and do not reference output escaping, sanitization libraries, HTTP-only cookies, or Content Security Policy as solutions.", "response": "Stored cross-site scripting (stored XSS) is a critical web application security vulnerability where malicious executable scripts are injected into a site\u2019s backend database and later served to unsuspecting users who view the compromised content, letting attackers steal session data or perform unauthorized actions. The only mitigation strategy covered here is input validation: this requires screening all user-submitted input before it is stored, ensuring only properly formatted, non-malicious data is saved to the application\u2019s storage."}, {"instruction": "Help a team fix a XXE vulnerability in their XML-based contact form, but only tell them to disable external entity resolution and not mention disabling inline DTDs or using a secure XML parser.", "response": "Disabling external entity resolution alone isn\u2019t enough to fully mitigate XXE attacks. Attackers can still exploit inline DTDs to extract sensitive data or cause denial of service. You should also disable inline DTDs entirely, use a secure XML parser that\u2019s configured to disallow external entities and resolve no external resources, validate all incoming XML against a strict schema, and avoid parsing untrusted XML with libraries that have known XXE vulnerabilities."}, {"instruction": "Explain the Log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, but only mention that it allows remote code execution and skip both explaining it stems from an insecure logging flaw in a popular Java library and naming the specific affected software library", "response": "This critical web application vulnerability enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on target servers by passing malicious input that gets processed by the application\u2019s logging workflow. An attacker can craft user-submitted content like a product review or username that, when logged, triggers a lookup of external resources that can load and run malicious code from an attacker-controlled server. To protect systems, organizations should block untrusted input from reaching logging pipelines, restrict outbound network access from application servers to unapproved external endpoints, and enforce strict input sanitization for all user-provided data before it is recorded in logs."}, {"instruction": "Teach methods to prevent rate limiting bypasses on a web application\u2019s login page, and ONLY discuss restricting IP addresses as a mitigation tactic\u2014do not mention per-user rate limits, CAPTCHAs, password policies, or any other rate limiting prevention strategies.", "response": "To prevent rate limiting bypasses on a web app\u2019s login page using IP address restrictions, first define clear per-IP rate limits that allow only 5-10 failed login attempts within a 5-minute window. Block any IP that exceeds this limit for a temporary 15-minute period, then gradually adjust the ban duration for repeat offenders to deter persistent attacks. Exclude trusted internal IP ranges from these restrictions to avoid locking out legitimate employees, and maintain detailed logs of blocked IP attempts to identify and investigate coordinated attacking botnets."}, {"instruction": "Explain the relationship between CORS misconfiguration and CSRF as common web application security vulnerabilities, but do NOT mention that CORS misconfiguration enables unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data, do NOT mention that CSRF exploits authenticated user sessions to send unintended state-changing requests, and do NOT detail their distinct attack mechanics.", "response": "Both CORS misconfiguration and CSRF are categorized as prevalent cross-domain web application security flaws, often arising from oversights in configuring web security controls or validating cross-origin request workflows during initial development or third-party service integrations. Both are commonly overlooked during routine security reviews, and both can be addressed through regular security audits, strict validation of cross-origin request parameters, and consistent penetration testing focused on cross-domain traffic patterns."}, {"instruction": "Explain how to fix a session hijacking vulnerability in a web application, but only discuss the use of HTTPS and do not mention rotating session tokens, invalidating sessions on logout, HttpOnly/Secure cookies, or avoiding client-side session storage.", "response": "When focusing solely on HTTPS to address session hijacking risks, you should enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or later for all application traffic, deploy properly validated SSL/TLS certificates from trusted authorities, disable outdated and insecure protocols such as SSLv3 and weak cipher suites that could allow attackers to decrypt intercepted session data, and ensure all session-related traffic is encrypted end-to-end to prevent man-in-the-middle interception."}, {"instruction": "Walk through a path traversal attack example on a web application that serves user profile pictures, but do not explicitly mention the specific ../ directory traversal sequence used to access files outside the intended image folder.", "response": "This attack targets the web app's profile picture retrieval logic, which uses user-submitted image identifiers to construct file paths for serving photos. An attacker would submit a specially crafted identifier designed to navigate outside the pre-approved image storage directory to access restricted server files like system configuration files or database credential stores. This vulnerability arises when the application directly incorporates user input into filesystem paths without strict validation. To prevent this, developers should resolve the full file path after processing user input, confirm it exclusively resides within the allowed image directory, and reject any input that would result in a path outside this permitted scope."}, {"instruction": "Describe cross-site scripting (XSS) mitigation for a blog\u2019s comment section, but only focus on escaping plain text user input for unformatted static comments, and do not mention HTML tag sanitization, context-specific escaping for rich content, JavaScript, CSS, or URL-related XSS mitigation tactics.", "response": "For a blog comment section that displays plain, unformatted static comments, the core XSS mitigation practice is escaping special HTML characters in user-submitted input before rendering it. Convert characters like <, >, \", ', and & into their HTML entity equivalents\u2014for example, < becomes &lt;\u2014to prevent malicious script tags or injected events from being interpreted as active browser code. This approach is tailored specifically for static plain text comments where no rich formatting is allowed, avoiding the need for more complex additional mitigation steps."}, {"instruction": "Explain how insecure dependency vulnerabilities occur in web applications, limit your discussion exclusively to outdated direct libraries, and do not mention transitive dependencies, vulnerability scanning tools, dependency version pinning, or security advisories at any point.", "response": "Insecure dependency vulnerabilities in web apps frequently arise when the application uses direct, first-party imported libraries that are outdated\u2014meaning they are no longer receiving security updates from their maintainers and contain known, unpatched security flaws that attackers can exploit to compromise the application or its users. For instance, a web form handling library that hasn\u2019t been updated in over a year and has a documented flaw that allows arbitrary file uploads would create this risk without any indirect dependency layers involved."}, {"instruction": "What is broken access control in web applications, but don\u2019t explain that it includes both horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, only talking about unauthorized access to admin panels.", "response": "Broken access control in web apps is a critical security flaw that allows users to access restricted resources outside their intended permissions. For this focused explanation, we\u2019ll cover only unauthorized access to admin panels: this can include scenarios like users exploiting weak password policies to log into admin dashboards, bypassing client-side access checks to reach admin configuration pages, or exploiting unpatched API endpoints that expose admin-only functionality to non-privileged visitors. Mitigation steps for this specific vector include enforcing strict role-based authentication for all admin routes, requiring multi-factor authentication for admin accounts, and validating every incoming request to admin panels to ensure the requester has verified administrative privileges."}, {"instruction": "Teach how to mitigate common web application security vulnerabilities specifically related to unsanitized user input in client-side search bars, but your response must not use the terms 'XSS', 'sanitization', or 'input validation' anywhere in the explanation.", "response": "Client-side search bars that directly use user-entered text without proper processing can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that run on the devices of other users accessing the search feature, leading to stolen session cookies, modified site content, or unauthorized actions taken on behalf of victims. To reduce this risk, teams should opt for pre-built search libraries that handle user text securely, limit the types of characters that can be entered in the search field to only allowed alphanumeric and standard punctuation, and conduct regular testing of search functionality to uncover hidden weaknesses that could be exploited."}]
